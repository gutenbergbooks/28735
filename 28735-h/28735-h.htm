<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>TWO MYSTERIES</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Not much like last summer, is it, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much, Frank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No Mexican bandits. No Chinese bad men. No
dens in Chinatown. Say, Jack, remember how you
felt when we were licked in our attempt to escape
from that dive out in San Francisco? Boy, that was
the time when things looked mighty blue. Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack?&#8221; In a louder tone.</p>
<p>Still no answer.</p>
<p>Frank turned around impatiently from where he
lounged in the open doorway of the radio station,
and faced his chum at the receiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, listening-in,&#8221; he exclaimed, and fell silent.
Facing about, he gazed southward to where, less
than a mile away, sparkled in the bright July sunshine
the clear waters of the open Atlantic.</p>
<p>Frank Merrick was thinking of the adventures
crowded into the lives of himself and his two chums,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
Jack Hampton and Bob Temple, during their summer
vacation the previous year. All three boys were
sons of wealthy parents and lived on country estates
at the far end of Long Island. Jack&#8217;s mother was
dead. Frank who was an orphan, lived with the
Temples. All had attended Harrington Hall Military
Academy, but Jack, a year older and a class
ahead of his chums, had graduated the previous
spring and already had spent his Freshman year
at Yale.</p>
<p>The previous year Jack had gone to New Mexico
with his father, an engineer, who was then superintendent
in charge of field operations of a syndicate
of independent oil operators. Mr. Hampton had
been captured by Mexican rebels, and rescued by the
boys, for Frank and Bob with Mr. Temple had joined
Jack after his father&#8217;s loss. Later Mr. Temple had
taken the boys on to San Francisco with him,
and there they had become involved in the plottings
of a gang of Chinese and white men, smuggling
coolies into the country in violation of the Exclusion
Act.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that Frank, dreaming
of those adventurous days as he lounged in the doorway,
felt a twinge of regret at what promised to be
a dull vacation by comparison.</p>
<p>It was true, he thought, they had everything to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
make them happy and keep them interested, however.
Here was the powerful radio station built by
Mr. Hampton under government license to use an
1,800 meter wave length, for purposes of trans-oceanic
experiment. Then, too, Frank and Bob
jointly owned a powerful all-metal plane, equipped
with radio, and adapted for land or water flying.
Besides, there was the new and powerful speed boat
bought for the three of them this summer by Mr.
Hampton and Mr. Temple.</p>
<p>And their homes were admirably located for vacationing,
too. On the far end of Long Island, miles
from another human habitation, with dense woods,
miles of lonely beach, and the open sea&mdash;all at their
command. Well, Frank thought, after all it might
not be so exciting a summer as the last, yet the three
of them ought to be able to have a pretty good time.</p>
<p>An exclamation of anger from Jack caused Frank
to face about. His chum had taken the receiver
from his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;That interference again?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Jack, rising and joining his chum
in the doorway. &#8220;Oh, there comes Bob,&#8221; he added,
pointing to a tall, broad figure swinging over the top
of a low sandhill from the beach.</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s glance followed in the direction Jack indicated.
Although Bob was still distant there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
a purposefulness about his stride and about the way
he waved a response to their greetings that caught
his chum&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob&#8217;s got something on his mind,&#8221; he said, with
conviction. &#8220;Wonder what it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, he found something, hiking along the
beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, he did,&#8221; agreed Frank. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel
like hitting it up with him this morning, felt kind of
lazy, as if I had spring fever. It would be just my
luck to have him make a discovery on the one morning
I wasn&#8217;t along with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s figure disappeared in a fold in the sandhills,
and Frank remembering Jack&#8217;s disgust over interference
in the radio receivers, began to question him
about it while waiting for Bob to arrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was it like this time, Jack?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, only worse,&#8221; answered Jack.
&#8220;Tune up to 1,375 meters for receiving and then
comes that snarling, whining, shrieking sound. It&#8217;s
steady, too. If it were dot and dash stuff, I might
be able to make something out of it. But somebody
somewhere is sending a continuous wave, at a meter
length, too, that is practically never used. From
1,100 meters to 1,400 meters, you know, is reserved
and unused wave territory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what it can be,&#8221; said Frank.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>Bob by now had approached within calling distance,
and he was so excited that he began to run.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; called Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody chasing you?&#8221; asked Jack, as the big
fellow ploughed through the sand and halted before
them.</p>
<p>Bob grinned tantalizingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you give to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At him, boys. At him,&#8221; cried Jack, making a
flying tackle.</p>
<p>His arms closed about Bob&#8217;s waist. At the same
time, Frank who had been standing to one side, dived
in. His grip tightened about Bob&#8217;s legs below the
knees. All three lads rolled over in the sand in a
laughing, struggling heap. Presently, Jack and
Frank bestrode the form of their big chum and
Frank, who sat on his chest, gripped Bob&#8217;s crisply
curling hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now will you tell?&#8221; he demanded in mock ferocity.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you big bully,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you pick on a fellow your size?&#8221;</p>
<p>With which remark, he gave a mighty heave&mdash;as
Frank afterwards described it &#8220;like a whale with a
tummyache&#8221;&mdash;and Frank and Jack went sprawling.
Then he stood upright, brushing the sand from his
khaki walking clothes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is that you down there?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Why,
where did you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as Frank made a clutch for his ankle, he
brushed him aside and sat down on the sand:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, listen, cut out the fooling. I&#8217;ve got something
to tell you fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob was so plainly excited that his chums were
impressed. Scrambling up they seated themselves
beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire away,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you say to my finding the tracks of
a peg-legged man coming up out of the sea, crossing
the sands of Starfish Cove and disappearing into the
trees beyond there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The inlet which Bob thus referred to was some
three miles distant, with a patch of timber some
twenty yards back from the water and a ring of low
sandhills behind the woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;A peg-legged man?&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;That certainly
sounds piratical. Go on. Your imagination is
working well to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he arrive in a boat?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>Bob nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I found where the boat had been run up on
the sand. But&mdash;he didn&#8217;t leave. The boat went
away without him. He disappeared inland, and
there were no tracks marking his return.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></p>
<p>Jack whistled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew. Did you follow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I follow? Huh. You can just bet I did
follow. And, say, fellows&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know now where that strange interference in
our radio receivers comes from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; demanded Jack, excitedly. &#8220;It was
cutting up didoes just a few minutes ago, just before
you arrived. Had been for some time, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;that&#8217;s not to be wondered at.
For when I followed Peg Leg&#8217;s tracks through the
trees I discovered a radio station tucked away in a
hollow behind the timber, with sandhills hiding it on
the landward side. I watched for a while from behind
a tree, but couldn&#8217;t see anybody. Then I hustled
here to tell you fellows about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Puzzled, the trio regarded each other in silence.
Presently Jack spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, fellows. There&#8217;s something queer
about this. A mysterious radio station, hidden away,
that sends a continuous wave on a hitherto unused
wave length. This has been going on for a week.
What does it mean? Then there is this man, this Peg
Leg, whom Bob discovers arriving from the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go together and investigate,&#8221; cried Frank,
jumping to his feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; declared Bob, also arising. &#8220;I
would have gone up to the station and done that
very thing, by myself, but&mdash;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;there was
something about it all&mdash;something sinister.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, you fellows,&#8221; said Jack, also
springing upright. &#8220;We can&#8217;t go putting our heads
into trouble recklessly. Bob&#8217;s good sense prompted
him when he refrained from pushing up to that radio
station by himself. There is something sinister about
this. That place is isolated, there are no roads near
it, nobody ever hikes along that beach except us.
How did the station ever come to be built? Why,
the material and supplies must have been brought by
boat. They couldn&#8217;t have been transported overland
very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do, though, Jack?&#8221; asked Frank,
impatiently. &#8220;You can&#8217;t reasonably expect to have a
thing like this rubbed under our noses without our
going ahead and investigating.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was so much plaintiveness in his voice, as
of a child from whom a toy was being withheld, that
Bob and Jack both burst into laughter. Then Jack
sobered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you what I think,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s only mid-afternoon.
Let&#8217;s get out your plane, and take a
look at this place from the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the old boat is working all right now,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
said Frank. &#8220;How about it, Bob? You know we
haven&#8217;t been up for two or three weeks, Jack. Bob&#8217;s
been tinkering with it. When I last saw him at work,
he seemed to have the engine entirely dismantled.
Looked to me as if he had enough parts for three
planes. Did you get it together again, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;And she&#8217;ll fly now, boy, believe
me. Well, come on,&#8221; he added, starting for the
hangar, not far distant but out of sight behind the
sandhills.</p>
<p>The others followed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE AIRPLANE APPEARS</h3>
</div>
<p>From the Hampton radio station to the hangar
on the Temple estate where Frank and Bob kept
their plane was a short jaunt, and the ground soon
was covered. Then Bob unlocked the big double
doors and rolled them back, and the three trundled
the plane out to the skidway where Jack spun the
propeller while Bob manipulated the controls. As
the machine got under way, Jack ran alongside and
was helped in by Frank.</p>
<p>Out over the sandy landing field trundled the plane
rising so quickly that Bob nodded with satisfaction.
The loving work he had put in on the machine had
not been wasted. It was in fine flying condition.</p>
<p>They were not far from the coast and in a very
short time were flying over the water, whereupon
Bob made a sweep to the right and the plane headed
westward. The Atlantic rocked gently below, serene
under a smiling sun and with only the merest whisper
of a breeze caressing it. On the southern horizon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
a plume or two of smoke, only faintly discernible,
marked where great liners were standing in for the
distant metropolis. To the north, far away, showed
a sail or two, of fishing craft or coastwise schooner.</p>
<p>An exclamation escaped Frank and he leaned sidewise,
gripping Jack by the arm and pointing with
his free hand. But Jack had a radio receiver clamped
on his head and was frowning. He glanced only
hastily in the direction indicated by Frank, then
shut his eyes as if in an effort at concentration.</p>
<p>Frank continued to gaze, then bent down and
unlashed a pair of binoculars from a pocket in the
pit and, putting the glasses to his eyes, threw back
his head and began scanning the sky. After staring
long minutes, he hastily put aside the glasses, lifted
the radio transmitter strapped to his chest and spoke
in it to Bob:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, there&#8217;s a plane overhead. So high you can&#8217;t
see it with the naked eye. But I spotted it before
it rose too high, and followed it with the glasses.
The fellow&#8217;s up where the sun plays tricks with your
eyesight. And, Bob, I&#8217;ve got a hunch he&#8217;s watching
us. There&#8217;s Starfish Cove below us now. Keep right
on flying. Don&#8217;t turn inland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob nodded, and the plane continued its way westward
offshore. Frank again took up the glasses and
searched the sky, gradually increasing the focal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
radius. An exclamation from Frank and a hurried
request in the transmitter presently reached Bob&#8217;s
ears:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut her off, Bob, and let&#8217;s land on the water.
Quick. I&#8217;ll explain in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obediently, big Bob shut off the engine, and the
plane coasted on a long slant to a safe landing some
hundreds of yards out from the sandy, deserted
shore.</p>
<p>Bob and Jack snatched the headpieces off, and
turned inquiringly to their chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; cried Frank, pressing the glasses into
Bob&#8217;s hands. &#8220;Take a look. That plane is landing
way back there, and I believe it is at Starfish Cove.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob was too late to see if the situation was as
Frank described, however. Putting up the glasses,
he turned to his chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us about it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I heard what you told Bob,
but not having the glasses I couldn&#8217;t see. At first,
when you punched me, besides, I was thinking over
that business of the strange interference with our
radio and wondering what it could be. So I didn&#8217;t
get to see. I suppose you were trying to point out
this other plane to me then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it was just a tiny speck at that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
time, but I could see it with the naked eye. However,
it disappeared immediately afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what made you believe the other plane was
watching us?&#8221; inquired Bob.</p>
<p>Frank laughed in half-embarrassed fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, one of my hunches,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His two chums grinned understandingly at each
other. It was a recognized fact among them that
Frank was super-sensitive and frequently, as a result,
received sharp impressions concerning people
and events which were unsupported by evidence at
the time, but which later proved to be correct. Frank
was the slightest of the trio, of only medium height
but wiry build, while Bob and Jack both were six
feet tall and Bob, besides, had a broad and powerful
frame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing spooks again?&#8221; chaffed Bob.</p>
<p>Immediately, they became more serious as Frank,
ignoring the banter, leaned forward and made his
proposal:</p>
<p>&#8220;That plane landed, and I believe it landed at
Starfish Cove. Let&#8217;s fly back and take a look. See
what&#8217;s it like, at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; approved Jack.</p>
<p>Bob had been taxying about slowly since landing,
in order to keep the engine going and the propeller
slowly revolving. Now he picked up speed, straightened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
out, shifted the lifting plane, and the machine
shot forward, skirled over the water and presently
took the air.</p>
<p>For some minutes they flew in silence, at no great
height, and a little distance out from the coast. Bob&#8217;s
attention was devoted to the plane, but Frank and
Jack scanned the shore with eager eyes. Presently
they saw what they were looking for. A strange
plane rode in the lazy swell offshore in Starfish
Cove. There was nobody aboard. Not a soul was
in sight on land. The little stretch of sandy beach,
between the two horns of the cove, stretched untenanted
back to the thick fringe of trees.</p>
<p>Bob swooped so low the plane almost skimmed the
water, and all three obtained a good view of the
stranger, before once more Bob soared aloft and
forged ahead. Looking back, Frank trained the
glasses on the scene. But nobody appeared from
among the trees, and, far as they could determine,
they were unobserved.</p>
<p>They made a quick run to their own landing
field, descended and put the plane away. Not until
the doors were closed and locked did they sit down
on the skidway outside the hangar to discuss what
they had seen. There had been remarks made by
all after they had seen the strange plane at close
range and on the hasty trip home, but all had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
too busy with their own thoughts for extended discussion.</p>
<p>Discovery of the plane had altered their original
plans to fly over the secret radio station. They had
decided not to advertise their presence as, if Frank
was correct in his surmise that the other plane had
been watching them, their return would create suspicion
and put the mysterious strangers on guard
against them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may be on a perfectly legitimate enterprise,
whoever they are,&#8221; Jack said, as all three took seats
on the skidway.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we may be fools for butting in where we
have no business to be,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;That your
idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;I have the feeling
that there&#8217;s something about all this business that
isn&#8217;t open and aboveboard. I, for one, vote that we
do our best to find out what is going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack sat silent for several moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t what concerns me at the present moment,
after all,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Whether these people
with their strange plane and their secret radio are
on legitimate business or not, doesn&#8217;t interest me
so much. What puzzles me&mdash;and I reckon it puzzles
the rest of you, too&mdash;is the design of that plane.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>The others nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a tiny thing,&#8221; was Frank&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was busy and couldn&#8217;t see much,&#8221; supplemented
Bob. &#8220;But what impressed me was her short hood.
Why, she looked as if she had no engine at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Frank. &#8220;I never saw a
plane like it. And I can&#8217;t recall any designs of that
nature, either. It must be a foreign-built plane, one
of those little one-man things the Germans and
French have been building.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head, puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something strange about it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;a
little thing like that, with practically no engine space.
Another thing that you fellows want to remember,
too, is that probably it has been flying about here
for some time, yet we have never heard it. Now,
down here the sound of most planes would travel far,
in this quiet and secluded place, where there are no
competing noises.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you say it has been flying about here for
some time?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the familiarity with which the aviator
landed shows he&#8217;s been at Starfish Cove before.
Evidently, after landing he struck inland to that
secret radio station, because we saw no sign of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t been up in the air for three weeks,&#8221;
said Frank. &#8220;That plane might easily have come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
and gone in that time without our seeing it. But,
surely, as Jack says, we would have heard it at
some time or other. Haven&#8217;t either of you heard
the sound of a plane lately?&#8221; he appealed to the
others. &#8220;I know I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob and Jack both shook their heads in negation.</p>
<p>&#8220;No planes ever come out this way,&#8221; Bob said.
&#8220;They fly south or north of us, but not out here.
I haven&#8217;t heard anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack rose and stretched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I, for one, vote that we do not pursue our
investigations into this mystery by going back and,
perhaps, getting peppered with gunshot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Jack,&#8221; protested Bob, the impetuous, &#8220;we
want to know what&#8217;s going on. You can&#8217;t have a
mystery dumped right in your own dooryard without
digging into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank was thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true, Bob, old thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just the
same, I agree with Jack. What do you say to laying
the matter before Uncle George and Mr. Hampton
at dinner? Jack and his father are coming over
to our house to-night, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;We can put it up to them,
and, perhaps, they will know something about the
man who owns that land around Starfish Cove,
where this secret radio is located.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>Big Bob grumbled. Delay irked his soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you old grumbler,&#8221; laughed Frank.
&#8220;Come on, I&#8217;ll give you some action. We have
several hours of good daylight left before dinnertime.
I&#8217;ll take you on at tennis. Della and I will
play you and Jack, and we won&#8217;t give you time to
worry about anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Della was Bob&#8217;s sister, two years younger than
he. Frank, whose parents were dead and who lived
with the Temples, referring to Mr. Temple, his guardian,
as &#8220;Uncle George,&#8221; was very fond of her.
The others joshed him about Della frequently. Bob
took occasion to do so now, as the three walked
away from the hangar toward the Temple home and
tennis courts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be looking at your partner
so often you won&#8217;t be able to play. Why, you won&#8217;t
even be good practice for Jack and me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE HAUNTED HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Della was lithe-limbed, quick of eye and strong
of wrist, a born tennis player. As for Frank, tennis
was the one sport at which he could excel his
chums. The result was that, despite the strong game
played by Jack and Bob, Frank and Della won two
sets, 7-5, 8-6.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton appeared on the scene when the
second set stood at six-all, bringing with him an
alert, thin-faced man of middle age, clad in the uniform
of a colonel in the United States Engineers.
Mr. Temple with his wife emerged from the house
to greet their guests, and all four were interested
spectators of the two concluding games which were
bitterly contested, went to deuce a number of times,
but finally were won by Della and Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack,&#8221; said Mr. Hampton, jokingly, as the
players joined the spectators at the conclusion of the
set; &#8220;I suppose you were just being chivalrous and
that&#8217;s why Della beat you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>Jack grinned. He and Bob knew they would be
in for a certain amount of twigging because of their
defeat, but he knew how to take it in good part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chivalrous? Oh, yes,&#8221; he scorned. &#8220;We&#8217;d have
beaten that pair of kids if we had been able. But
it couldn&#8217;t be done. Della&#8217;s got a serve there that
would put Mlle. Lenglen to shame. As for Frank,
the boy goes crazy when he plays tennis.&#8221;</p>
<p>A general laugh greeted his generous praise of his
opponents. Then Mr. Hampton turned to his companion
and introduced him to the players as &#8220;Colonel
Graham.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that the players hurried away to brush up
and prepare for dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we speak of our discoveries this afternoon?&#8221;
asked Frank, brushing his hair while big
Bob peered over his shoulder into the mirror, adjusting
his tie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, on account of this Colonel Graham. Who
is he, by the way, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack did not know. He recalled, or believed he
recalled, that his father had spoken of a friend named
Colonel Graham who was a famous engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if he&#8217;s a friend of Dad&#8217;s,&#8221; added Jack, with
calm confidence, &#8220;you can count on it that he&#8217;s a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
good sport. It will be safe to speak about our discoveries
before him.&#8221;</p>
<p>At dinner it developed that Colonel Graham was,
indeed, a friend of Mr. Hampton. They had been
classmates years before at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. During the World War, Colonel
Graham had obtained a reserve commission in the
Engineers and, at the conclusion of hostilities, while
thousands of other officers were being demobilized,
he had been given a commission in the regular army
because of his distinguished record.</p>
<p>At dinner, the older people took the lead in the
conversation, while the boys and Della were content
to listen unless addressed. Colonel Graham was a
brilliant conversationalist, and once he became
launched on a series of war stories there was no time
for the boys to interrupt, nor had they any inclination.
He had been one of the handful of American
engineers impressed into a make-shift army by General
Byng to stop the Germans when they smashed
through at Cambrai, and his gripping account of
those days and nights of superhuman effort to hold
back the enemy until reinforcements arrived, had the
boys neglecting their dinner and sitting on the edges
of their chairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton was a radio enthusiast. It was his
interest in radio development, in fact, which had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
caused him to build the station on his estate, for
purposes of trans-oceanic experiment. Eventually,
therefore, the talk came around to the subject of
radio. Colonel Graham was well-informed, and he
told of several army officers then at work on behalf
of the government at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, experimenting with radio-controlled
automobiles, tanks and water craft.</p>
<p>An exclamation from Jack drew attention to him
and covered him with confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack,&#8221; said his father, in mild reproof.
And he looked expectantly at his son as if awaiting
an explanation.</p>
<p>Frank came to his rescue. His quick mind also
had grasped the significance of Colonel Graham&#8217;s
remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what Jack is thinking of, Mr. Hampton,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;He&#8217;s thinking of a radio-controlled airplane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Graham smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said, tolerantly. &#8220;I mentioned only
that these government experts were experimenting
with radio-controlled automobiles, tanks and water
craft. Of course, airplanes are being studied, too.
Is that what you mean?&#8221; he asked, looking inquiringly
at Jack. &#8220;I understand you lads are interested
in flying.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; answered Jack, flushing a bit. &#8220;To tell
you the truth, we saw a plane to-day of strange
design. And we had reason to believe it was controlled
by radio. I was puzzled at the time. I didn&#8217;t
think of radio controls. But your remarks about the
officers at Massachusetts Tech. were illuminating.
I see now that this plane must have been radio-controlled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank and Bob nodded approval. Their eyes were
shining. Mr. Hampton, Mr. Temple and Colonel
Graham showed startled interest. Della leaned forward
close to Frank and looked at him reproachfully,
a hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you never told me a thing about it,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t have any time to tell you,&#8221; whispered
Frank, in an undertone.</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton was speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you see this plane, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dad,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;it was this way.&#8221; Then
he paused and looked at his chums. &#8220;Shall I tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Jack,&#8221; urged Frank.</p>
<p>Bob nodded approval.</p>
<p>With that Jack told as briefly as possible the circumstances
of their day&#8217;s adventure, and also spoke
of the recent interference in their radio receivers by
a sharp and continuous dash sounded over a wave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
length of 1,375 meters. A frown of growing concentration
fastened on Mr. Temple&#8217;s brow as Jack
proceeded. When it was apparent that Jack had
concluded, Mr. Temple leaned forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspected there was something mysterious
about that man,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What man?&#8221; asked Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>The others at the table looked blank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, the chap who bought the old Brownell
house and property. You know the place. There
are about 750 acres of land, mainly timber. This
inlet, Starfish Cove as the boys call it, is on the
property. And there is an old house back in the
trees. It is isolated, there is no habitation near, and
the house has a bad name to boot. Some of the old-timers
in the settlement at the crossroads declare the
place is haunted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that is part of the Brownell property?&#8221; asked
Mr. Hampton.</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other. Della surreptitiously
squeezed Frank&#8217;s hand beneath the table.
This promised to be interesting. The Brownell place
was one of the delightful bugaboos of their childhood.
Old Captain Brownell, a Yankee whaling
skipper, was long since dead. The house had stood
boarded up and untenanted for years. Tradition
declared he had committed acts of piracy on the high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
seas during the period of his whaling voyages and
that, having retired uncaught, he had come down to
this secluded nook and built the great house in order
to hide there from some of his old associates whom
he had cheated, but that they had found and slain
him. It was his ghost, it was said in the countryside,
which haunted the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Mr. Temple, in answer to Mr.
Hampton&#8217;s question. &#8220;Starfish Cove and all that
land around there, where Bob found this secret radio
plant located, is part of the Brownell property.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is this man who bought it?&#8221; asked
Bob, putting the question in all minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even know his name,&#8221; confessed Mr.
Temple. &#8220;But what I do recall are some things told
me by McKay, a real estate dealer in the city who had
the Brownell property on his list for a long time.
He said this chap who bought the place impressed him
as a man who only recently had come into the possession
of money, and he wondered what he wanted with
the Brownell property. The newly-rich man usually
wants to make a splurge, he doesn&#8217;t want to buy a
country home away off somewhere, in an out of the
way nook, where people can&#8217;t see him. He wants to
be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;This man, on the contrary, apparently wanted
seclusion&mdash;and he wanted a place in a secluded spot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
on the seacoast. That was his impressing requirement.
So McKay sold him the Brownell place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afterward, said McKay, he learned the new
owner had put up signs all around the property,
warning away trespassers. McKay said he even
understood guards were to be employed to keep out
intruders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the landward side of that old Brownell place,
Dad, they&#8217;ve built a high fence of heavy strands of
wire on steel poles,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I bumped into it
the other day. They haven&#8217;t quite reached the shore
with it, however, although I suppose they intend to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is interesting,&#8221; said Mr. Hampton.
&#8220;I wonder&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, looking thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, Dad?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;New York undoubtedly
is the center of powerful groups of men seeking to
evade the prohibition law by bringing liquor illicitly
into the country. Much of the liquor is brought
by ship from the Bahamas and the West Indies,
and then smuggled ashore in various ways. Perhaps,
the old Brownell house, built by a pirate of
yesterday, is the home of a modern pirate, who directs
activities from this secluded spot.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ON THE TRAIL</h3>
</div>
<p>After a rather late breakfast next morning for,
it being vacation, the boys were under no necessity
to rise early and being healthy lads took full measure
of sleep, Jack appeared at the Temple home, and the
three went into conference. Mr. Temple, head of a
big exporting firm, had left early for the city by
automobile. Mr. Hampton, reported Jack, had done
likewise with his guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellows,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;when I got up this morning,
it was with the feeling that this mystery was too
good to be overlooked.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the way I feel about it,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I
told Bob when we were dressing that we were in luck,
because right at the moment it was beginning to
look as if we were in for a dull summer, Fortune
went and put an exciting mystery on our doorstep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Big Bob yawned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you fellows don&#8217;t know when you have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
good thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I suppose you want to go
and stir up a lot of trouble as you did last summer.
Why can&#8217;t you let well enough alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were in the sitting room shared by Bob and
Frank, and the latter picking up a handy pillow
promptly smothered his big chum with it and then
sat on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind him, Jack,&#8221; he panted, in the resulting
tussle. &#8220;He&#8217;s always like this when he gets up in
the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spirited engagement followed, from which Jack
discreetly kept apart. Presently, when the couch
was a wreck and Bob had Frank over his knees and
was preparing to belabor him, Jack interfered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to reason, you fellows,&#8221; he pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we listen to the proposal, Frank?&#8221; asked
Bob, now fully awake, and grinning broadly. &#8220;Or
shall we muss him up a bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ark to his Royal &#8217;Ighness,&#8221; shouted Frank, his
equilibrium restored. &#8220;&#8217;Ear. &#8217;Ear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Bob, addressing Jack with mock
solemnity. &#8220;My friend says you are to be spared.
But, mind you, it must be a good proposal. Now,
out with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack, ensconced in a deep easy chair, uncrossed his
knees and leaned forward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You remember what was said last night about
the operations of the liquor smugglers in and around
New York?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>The others nodded.</p>
<p>After the conversation the previous night had been
directed by the revelations of the boys regarding
their mysterious neighbors, and by Mr. Hampton&#8217;s
comments on the operations of liquor smugglers,
the boys had learned from the older men surprising
facts regarding the situation.</p>
<p>Since the adoption of prohibition, they had been
told, liquor-smuggling had grown to such an extent
that a state of war between the smugglers and the
government forces practically existed. Single vessels
and even fleets were engaged by the smugglers
to bring liquor up from the West Indies and land it
on the Long Island and New Jersey coasts, and to
combat these operations the government had formed
a so-called &#8220;Dry-Navy&#8221; comprising an unknown
number of speedy submarine chasers. A number of
authentic incidents known to Colonel Graham and
to Mr. Hampton and Mr. Temple had been related
in which the daring of the smugglers had discomfited
the government men, in one case a cargo of
liquor having been landed at a big Manhattan dock
by night and removed in trucks while a sub chaser
patrolling the waterfront passed the scene of operations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
several times, unsuspecting. There were other
stories, too, of how the tables were turned, an occasion
being cited when a sub chaser put a shot across
the bow of what appeared to be a Gloucester fishing
schooner which thereupon showed a clean pair of
heels and tried to escape but was run down and
captured inside the three-mile limit and proved to
contain a $30,000 cargo of West Indian rum.</p>
<p>Some of these facts, of course, had appeared in the
newspapers. Others had not been made public. But,
far from New York City as they were and not
interested in reading about news events, for they had
their own interest to engage their attention, the boys
were not familiar with the situation. What they
had been told came as a tremendously interesting
revelation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; continued Jack, as Bob and Frank
prepared to listen; &#8220;remembering what we heard
last night about the liquor smugglers, it certainly
seems likely, doesn&#8217;t it, that the man who has bought
the haunted Brownell house, built a secret radio plant
and introduced a radio-controlled airplane into our
exclusive neighborhood, may be involved with the
smugglers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Righto, Jack,&#8221; Frank declared. &#8220;But what&#8217;s your
proposal?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Simply that we do a little investigating on our
own account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you intend to propose that we go nosing
around the Brownell place, trying to spy and snoop,
I vote against it,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;I ran away yesterday,
after discovering that radio plant, because I
felt danger in the air. With a wire fence built to
keep out intruders and with New York gunmen
posted in the woods, I have a feeling it wouldn&#8217;t be
healthy to do any investigating. If I were tiny as
Frank here&#8221;&mdash;reaching over to rumple his chum&#8217;s
hair&mdash;&#8220;it might do. They couldn&#8217;t hit me. But,
as it is, I&#8217;d make a fine target.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack smiled and nodded agreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed on that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dad always tells me
it is only a foolhardy idiot who puts his head into
danger unnecessarily. But that isn&#8217;t the kind of
investigating I had in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, first of all, this is a fine day for flying,&#8221;
answered Jack, pointing out the open window, to
where warm sunshine lay over the country and the
sparkling sea in the distance. &#8220;You fellows lie abed
so long. You haven&#8217;t had a chance yet to see what
an ideal day it is; warm, cloudless, and with hardly
a trace of wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s flying got to do with it?&#8221; asked Bob.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
&#8220;We saw yesterday about all we can see from the
air. Any more flying over there will make somebody
suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of a little trip to Mineola,&#8221; said
Jack. &#8220;Then we can leave the old bus on the flying
field there and motor into the city in an hour. Once
in the city we might ask Mr. McKay, your father&#8217;s
real estate friend, who the fellow is who has bought
the old Brownell house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what, Hawkshaw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Bob, don&#8217;t be such a grouch,&#8221; protested
Jack. &#8220;What if nothing comes of it? We&#8217;ll have
had a good trip, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not grouching, Jack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Only I
wanted to see what you had in mind. If it&#8217;s just a
flying trip you&#8217;re after, well and good. I&#8217;m with
you. The plane is limbered up since I worked it
over, and yesterday&#8217;s little spin gave me a taste for
more, too. But if you are really intent on getting
at the bottom of this mystery, I have a proposal, too.
What&#8217;s the matter with our hunting up the Secret
Service men? Maybe they would be glad of our tip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, old ice wagon,&#8221; cried Frank, slapping
his chum&#8217;s broad shoulder.</p>
<p>Jack likewise nodded approval. The previous summer
the boys had been instrumental in thwarting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
the plots of an international gang on the California
coast to smuggle Chinese coolies into the country
in violation of the Chinese Exclusion Act. As a
consequence, they had made the acquaintance of
Inspector Burton of the Secret Service and had
even been called to Washington to receive the personal
thanks of the Chief for their service and to be
introduced to the President. Their adventures during
that exciting period are related in &#8220;The Radio
Boys on Secret Service Duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Jack, bounding to his feet.
&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go. It&#8217;s ten o&#8217;clock now. If we
hurry, we can cover the sixty miles to Mineola, put
up the plane, and be in the city by noon. That will
give us two or three hours there, and we can be
home easily in time for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell Della where we
are going, in case Mother isn&#8217;t up yet. She had a
bad headache, and may be staying in bed. You fellows
go down to the hangar, and start getting out
the plane. I&#8217;ll join you right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack and Frank hurried away, while Bob went to
execute his mission. When he rejoined them at the
hangar, the plane already was on the skidways.</p>
<p>&#8220;You take the wheel going up, Bob,&#8221; said Frank.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll pilot her home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trip to Mineola flying field, where Bob and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
Frank and Mr. Temple as well had taken their flying
lessons, was made without incident. Planning not
to arouse the suspicions of anybody who might be on
watch, Bob was careful to steer a course over the
water a good mile out from Starfish Cove. Watching
through the glass, Frank reported the little plane
missing and no sign of life on the tiny beach or in
the woods beyond where the radio plant was hidden.</p>
<p>Mechanics at the flying field, who knew them,
took the plane in charge when they alighted. Although
they had planned to hire an automobile to
take them into the city, they learned they were in
time to catch an express train, and boarded it. After
a fast run, they emerged from the train which had
borne them through the tunnel under the East River
and under Manhattan and ascended to the main waiting
room of the Pennsylvania Terminal. The hour
still lacked several minutes of noon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not particularly hungry,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;If
you fellows feel the same way about it, suppose we
defer luncheon until we have seen Mr. McKay.
Probably we can catch him at his office now. But
if we lunch first, there is no telling when we can get
to see him. These business men take three or four
hours for lunch lots of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead on,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;Do you know where his
office is located?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At Times Square,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been there
once with Dad. Come on. We&#8217;ll take the Subway.
It&#8217;s only one station up the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three boys were familiar with the great city,
having lived on Long Island all their lives. Although
many miles distant from New York, they
were frequent visitors. Crossing the big waiting
room, they entered the West Side subway, and a few
minutes later disembarked from an express train at
the Times Square station. Mounting to the surface,
Bob led the way to a towering office building. An
express elevator shot them to the twentieth story,
and there they entered the anteroom of a handsome
suite of offices occupied by the J. B. McKay Realty
Corporation, and inquired of the information clerk&mdash;a
young woman&mdash;for the head of the firm. Here,
however, they met disappointment. Mr. McKay was
not in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. McKay&#8217;s secretary is here, however,&#8221; said
the clerk, taking pity on their evident dismay. &#8220;Wait
a moment and I&#8217;ll call him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke into the telephone receiver, and then
nodded brightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Higginbotham will see you,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He
is in that corner office.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was undecided. He looked to his companions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we try him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May as well,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;Probably he can
give us the information we want, just as well as
Mr. McKay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following directions, they entered a roomy office,
furnished in walnut and with walnut panelling on the
walls. Two big windows gave a commanding view
up Broadway below and west to the Hudson river
and the Jersey shore. A small, sharp-eyed man,
with graying hair, immaculately dressed in gray, rose
from the desk as they entered and regarded them
inquiringly.</p>
<p>Jack wasted no time on preliminaries, but after
introducing himself and his companions, stated their
mission. They wanted to know who was the man
who had bought the old Brownell place, and what
was known about him.</p>
<p>His name? Mr. Higginbotham could not recall
it. He doubted whether there was a record of it at
hand. The old Brownell place? Yes, he remembered
the property. Why were the young men interested.</p>
<p>Sharp-eyed Frank detected a slight start at Jack&#8217;s
query. Moreover, he thought there was an air of
guarded watchfulness about Higginbotham, for no
apparent reason. That mysterious sixth sense which
so often had been of value in the past now came to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
the fore. Before Jack could reply, he took over the
conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, lightly, &#8220;being neighbors, we were
just curious, we wondered who had bought the
haunted house. That&#8217;s all. My uncle, Mr. Temple,
is a friend of Mr. McKay. So, being near, we
thought we would stop in and ask him. That&#8217;s
all. Sorry to have bothered you. Good day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And taking the bewildered Jack and Bob by their
arms, he gently propelled them to the door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>PURSUING THE &#8220;RADIO&#8221; PLANE</h3>
</div>
<p>Not before they had reached the street did Frank
vouchsafe an explanation of his amazing conduct.
Then Jack, refusing to be put aside any more,
gripped him by the arm and swung him about so
that they stood face to face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with it, now,&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Why did you
hurry us away from that office? And why didn&#8217;t
you tell Mr. Higginbotham our reason for trying to
discover something about this man who has taken
the Brownell place?&#8221;</p>
<p>Big Bob quizzically regarded his smaller companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Frank had another
hunch. Didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; confessed Frank, &#8220;and that&#8217;s about all I
had to go on, too. But it was a strong one. Something
inside of me kept saying that man Higginbotham
wasn&#8217;t to be trusted. There was a look in
his eyes, watchful and cunning. And he made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
little start when we asked him about the Brownell
place. I don&#8217;t know. There was nothing definite,
nothing I can point out to you now. I feel almost
ashamed of myself, as a matter of fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob put an arm over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Forget it. I&#8217;ll put my
faith in your hunches every time. Well, what&#8217;ll we
do now? Look up the Secret Service men, or have
lunch first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s eat,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>He was a bit out of sorts because his plan to pump
Mr. McKay had miscarried. Bob who read him
aright, grinned and slapped him resoundingly on the
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much money you got, old thing?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;I came without any. Do we eat at a Child&#8217;s
restaurant or at the Knickerbocker Grill.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood on the corner of Broadway and Forty-second
street, immediately in front of the Knickerbocker.
Toward it Bob, who was fond of good
eating, gazed with longing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too high-priced for my purse,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Besides,
we haven&#8217;t the time to waste over eating there.
Takes too long. We must be on our way. However,
I can do you better than a lunch counter, so come on.
I know a place around here on Forty-second street.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking the lead, Jack led the way through the busy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
throng that congests traffic at Times Square at all
hours of the day and practically all of the night,
too. They turned in at a small restaurant on Forty-second
street, and despatched lunch in double-quick
time.</p>
<p>During the course of the meal, Bob gave an exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I planned to call Dad and tell him we were in
town and why,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s too late now.
He&#8217;ll have gone out to lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack knew it would be impossible to reach his
father by telephone. Mr. Hampton the night before
had announced he planned to spend the day going
over certain engineering plans with Colonel Graham,
and Jack had only a vague idea where they would be
in conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for the Secret Service men,&#8221; said Jack, at
conclusion of the meal. &#8220;Luckily I have a card of
introduction from Inspector Burton in my purse.
Also it gives the address&mdash;down on Park Row.
Well, the Subway again. Only this time, the East
Side branch to Brooklyn Bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more stemming the torrent of human traffic
flowing along Forty-second street, the boys made
their way eastward to the Grand Central station,
boarded a southbound express train on the Subway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
tracks, and were whisked to their destination at
lightning-like speed.</p>
<p>Park Row also was crowded, the noon hour
crowds of workers, from the towering skyscrapers
of the financial district to the south, loitering in
City Hall Park and sauntering up and down the
thoroughfare to which the park gives its name. Jack
and Bob felt their spirits react to the impulse of the
busy life around them, but the sensitive Frank, who
hated crowds, became peevish.</p>
<p>He urged his companions to hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget the sight-seeing,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and let&#8217;s move
along. The quicker I&#8217;m out of this mass of humanity,
the better pleased I&#8217;ll be. These crowds of New
Yorkers don&#8217;t give a fellow a chance to take a deep
breath for fear he&#8217;ll crush in somebody else&#8217;s ribs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; said Jack, turning in at a tall
office building, near lower Broadway, with old St.
Paul&#8217;s and its churchyard, filled now with loitering
clerks spending their dinner hour among the graves,
just across the way.</p>
<p>Once more an express elevator whisked the trio
skyward. At the fourteenth floor they alighted, made
their way to an office, the glass door of which bore
no lettering except the number &#8220;12,&#8221; and entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inspector Condon, please,&#8221; said Jack, to a fat
young man, smoking a long black cigar, who sat in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
his shirtsleeves at a desk, reading through a mass
of papers.</p>
<p>The latter got to his feet, and held out his hand.
He had a jolly face which broke into a grin of welcome,
as he extended his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jack was rather taken aback. He had not expected
to meet so young a man in a position of such responsibility.
This man could not have been more
than 26 or 28 years of age. Passing over his
astonishment, however, Jack introduced himself and
his companions and then extended the card of introduction
given him a year before by Inspector Burton,
when they left Washington, but which heretofore
had not been presented.</p>
<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Inspector Condon, reading the note
on the back of the card; &#8220;you are the three chaps
who made such a stir in that business in California?
Mighty glad to meet you. Sit down. What can I
do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That remains to be seen,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;However,
we have run into something rather curious, and we
thought you might be interested. So if you have
time to listen, we&#8217;ll spin the yarn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the time in the world, friend,&#8221; said Inspector
Condon, genially. &#8220;Shoot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>Thereupon, Jack proceeded to relate the story of
the secret radio plant, the mysterious plane probably
controlled by radio and thus able to operate in silence,
and the facts as they had obtained them from Mr.
Temple regarding the occupant of the old Brownell
place known as the &#8220;haunted house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; said Inspector Condon; &#8220;if that fellow is
a liquor smuggler, the &#8216;haunted house&#8217; has spirits in
it, all right, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he laughed uproariously at his own joke.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, now, boys,&#8221; he added, sobering; &#8220;an investigation
into this matter would be somewhat outside
of my province. However, I&#8217;ll place this information
before the prohibition enforcement officials,
who will be glad to get it, I can assure you. Let me
thank you, in behalf of the government, for coming
to us with your information.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few more moments of conversation, during
which Inspector Condon made a note of their
names and addresses, the boys left.</p>
<p>At the door, Jack turned for a last word.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can be of any help,&#8221; he said, &#8220;call on us.
We have a radio plant and an airplane at our command,
and, besides, are admirably situated near the
scene.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fretting for more adventure, are you?&#8221; asked
Inspector Condon, clapping him on the shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a kind offer, and I&#8217;ll pass it along to the
proper people to handle this matter. If they need
any help, you&#8217;ll hear from them shortly. I expect
they won&#8217;t let any grass grow under their feet on
this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>When once more they stood on the sidewalk, Jack&#8217;s
gaze lifted to the clock in the tower of St. Paul&#8217;s.
Two o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we haven&#8217;t gotten very far with our adventure,&#8221;
he said, a bit dispiritedly. &#8220;I thought we
would start something that would give us a bit of
excitement. But, apparently, all we have done has
been to let the whole business slip out of our hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, forget it,&#8221; said Frank irritably. The noise,
the heat and the bustle of the city had irritated his
nerves. &#8220;Come on. Let&#8217;s get out of this. I hate
all this hurly-burly. If we take the Subway over to
the Flatbush Avenue terminal of the Long Island
Railroad, we&#8217;ll just about have time to make an
express to Mineola.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roar of the Subway was not conducive to
conversation, and little further was said until the
trio boarded the train in Brooklyn, and pulled out
for the short run to Mineola. Early editions of
several afternoon newspapers were purchased at the
terminal newsstand, and the boys settled down to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
glance at the day&#8217;s happenings when once ensconced
in the train.</p>
<p>Presently Frank, his irritation forgotten now that
the city was being left behind, called the attention of
his companions to a first page story under flaring
headlines which read:</p>
<p style='margin-left:0.0em; margin-right:0.0em; text-align:center'>RUM RUNNERS LAND<br />
BIG LIQUOR CARGO;<br />
ELUDE &#8220;DRY NAVY.&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I haven&#8217;t been reading any of this stuff,&#8221;
said Frank. &#8220;But after what the men told us last
night about the size of these operations, and with
my interest aroused by developments at Starfish
Cove, I&#8217;m beginning to see that this defiance of the
prohibition law is just about the most stirring thing
before the Nation to-day. At least, here on the
Eastern seaboard, where these smugglers are organized
and have a handy base in the West Indies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others nodded agreement, and the conversation
proceeded in similar vein until they tumbled from
the train at Mineola. Speeding to the flying field in
a taxi, they were soon aboard the plane. This time
Frank took the wheel. And to the friendly farewells
of the mechanics, they took off and began the homeward
journey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>After forty minutes of speedy flying, Bob, idly
scanning the sky through the glass, focussed upon
a tiny speck in the distance. All three had clamped
on their radio receivers and hung the transmitters by
straps across their shoulders. Speaking into the
transmitter now, Bob announced:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that radio-controlled plane is flying away
from us, out to sea, off to the right. I&#8217;m going to
tune up to that 1,375-meter wave length, and we&#8217;ll
see if there&#8217;s a continuous dash in the receivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered Jack, &#8220;but look out for
your eardrums. The interference at that wave length
is very sharp and you want to be ready to tune down
at once, or your head will feel as if it were ready to
burst.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later the high crashing shriek, with
which Jack had become familiar of late, signalled
in the receivers, and Bob promptly tuned down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow,&#8221; said he. &#8220;That&#8217;s it, all right. That&#8217;s
the continuous dash which is being sent out from the
secret radio plant to control that little plane. Let&#8217;s
keep it in sight, Frank, and see where it goes. Don&#8217;t
close in on it. Keep just about this distance. I can
watch it through the glass, and I&#8217;ll give you your
bearings if you lose sight of it. Probably there is
only one man aboard, and he won&#8217;t have a glass, and
won&#8217;t know we are following him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; responded Frank. &#8220;Here&#8217;s where
we&#8217;d turn toward shore. But we&#8217;ll stick to his trail
a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he began edging the plane out to sea.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A FALL INTO THE SEA</h3>
</div>
<p>Out over the shining sea flew the glistening all-metal
plane, and the spirits of the boys lifted to the
chase. The oldest fever of the blood known to man
is that of the chase. It comes down to us from our
prehistoric ancestors who lived by the chase, got
their daily food by it, wooed and won by it, and
fought their battles by it in that dim dawn of time
when might was right and the law of tooth and claw
was the only rede.</p>
<p>Gone was the irritability that had possessed Frank
in the noise and din, the crowding walls and swarming
hordes of human beings, back in the city. Below
him lay the broad Atlantic, from their height
seeming smooth as a ball-room floor, with the surface
calm and unruffled. No land was in sight ahead.
The water stretched to infinity, over the edge of the
world. For a wonder, not a sail broke that broad
expanse due south, although to the west were several
streamers of smoke where ships stood in for port,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
hull down on the far horizon, while closer at hand
was a little dot which Bob, swinging the glasses,
made out to be a four-masted schooner.</p>
<p>It was a long distance off, ten or fifteen miles,
judged Bob. The tiny plane was heading in that
direction. Was it bearing away for the schooner?
The question leaped into Bob&#8217;s mind. He put it
into spoken words, into the transmitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a schooner southwest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
plane is going in that direction. Bear up a trifle,
Frank, and slow her down. Let&#8217;s see whether the
plane is heading for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank slowed the engine and altered the course
sufficiently to keep the plane in view on the new tack,
but not to bring them so close to it as to arouse
suspicion. In a few moments, all could see the tiny
speck coasting down on a long slant and Bob, watching
through the glasses, exclaimed excitedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The little fellow is going to land. There, he&#8217;s
on the water now. He&#8217;s taxying close to the ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to climb,&#8221; stated Frank, suiting action
to word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Let me have the glasses
a minute, Bob, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob complied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe they know of our presence,&#8221; Jack
presently declared. &#8220;Do you fellows consider the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
plane was forced to land? Is that how it happened
to come down near the schooner? There doesn&#8217;t
seem to be any attempt to put out a boat and get the
pilot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forced to land, my eye,&#8221; said Bob, repossessing
himself of the glasses. &#8220;Do you want to know what
I think? I believe the pilot is holding a confab with
the schooner. By Jiminy, that&#8217;s right, too. And it&#8217;s
ended. He&#8217;s taxying again, and starting to rise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank, at Bob&#8217;s words, had swung away again to
the south. After describing a long circle, which
carried them so far aloft and so wide of the ship as to
lose it from sight, he again turned the plane toward
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect they never saw us, either from the
schooner or the plane,&#8221; Jack said. &#8220;There was never
any indication of alarm. Of course, we were too
far off to tell exactly, even spying through the glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow, however,&#8221; replied Frank. &#8220;I have the
feeling that they didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t what?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t see us,&#8221; answered Frank.</p>
<p>Frank had accelerated the speed of the engine, and
was driving at eighty miles an hour, straight for
home. Suddenly, an exclamation from Bob, who
again was swinging his glasses over the sea below,
smote the ears of the boys.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s the matter with that little plane.
Say&#8221;&mdash;a breathless pause&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s falling. Come on,
Frank. We&#8217;ll have to see if we can help. Swoop
down. There, to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rapidly Frank began spiralling and in a very short
time was near enough to the small plane for it to be
seen clearly with the naked eye. It had been flying at
a considerable height. As the boys watched, it went
into a dive, with the pilot struggling desperately to
flatten out. He succeeded, when not far from the
surface of the ocean. As a result, instead of diving
nose foremost into the water, the plane fell flat with
a resounding smack, there was a breathless moment
or two when it seemed as if the little thing would be
swamped, then it rode lightly and buoyantly on the
little swells.</p>
<p>Descending to the water, Frank taxied up close to
the other plane. The figure of the pilot hung
motionless over the wheel. Probably, considered the
boys, the man had been flung about and buffeted
until he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll close up to him head on,&#8221; Frank said. &#8220;Then,
if necessary, one of you can climb into the other
plane and see what we can do to help. Probably the
thing to do will be to get him aboard here, and carry
him ashore.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Righto,&#8221; said Bob, climbing out to the fuselage,
behind the slowly revolving propeller. &#8220;Now take
it easy. We don&#8217;t want to smash. I can drop into
the water and swim a stroke or two, and get aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the boys swung up close, however, the figure at
the wheel of the other plane stirred. Then the man
lifted his head and looked at them, in dazed fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Higginbotham,&#8221; exclaimed Frank, under his
breath. &#8220;Well, what do you know about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was, indeed, the man they had interviewed
earlier that day in the McKay realty offices, back in
New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;How in the world did he get here?&#8221; asked Jack,
who also had recognized the other.</p>
<p>Frank had brought their plane to a halt. It bobbed
up and down slowly on the long ground swell, not
far from the smaller machine.</p>
<p>Bob was still astride the fuselage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he called. &#8220;We saw you fall and came
over to see if we could help. Engine gone wrong,
or what was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Higginbotham was rapidly recovering his senses.
He stared at his interlocutor keenly, then at the
others. Recognition dawned, then dismay, in his
eyes. But he cloaked the latter quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, aren&#8217;t you the lads who were in my office
to-day?&#8221; he asked, ignoring Bob&#8217;s proffer of help.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Mr. Higginbotham, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; answered
Bob. &#8220;Yes, we are the fellows you spoke to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world are you doing out here?&#8221; Higginbotham
demanded, sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we told you we lived near here. We had
flown to Mineola and then motored to the city. And
we were just flying home when we saw you fall, and
came over to do what we could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Higginbotham stared from one to the other. Had
he seen them pursue him and spy on him as he visited
the schooner? That was the question each boy asked
himself. Apparently, he had not done so, for his
next question was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you fly around here often in your plane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank took a hand in the conversation. If big
Bob were left to carry on alone, he might blunderingly
give this man an inkling of what the boys knew
or suspected about their mysterious neighbors. Frank
felt that his chill of suspicion, experienced when he
encountered Higginbotham in New York, was being
justified. Decidedly, this man must be in with the
mysterious inhabitant of the old Brownell place.
Equally certain was it that he had lied in stating he
did not know the name of the man who had bought
the property.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;we haven&#8217;t had the plane out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
for weeks until a day or two ago, when we made a
trial spin, and again to-day. We&#8217;ve been busy for
a month overhauling it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, thought Frank, ought to stave off Higginbotham&#8217;s
suspicions. Evidently, the other was feeling
around to learn whether they had flown sufficiently
of late to have spied out the secret radio plant
or seen the radio-controlled plane in operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; Frank said himself, &#8220;that it is a
complete surprise to him to find there is a plane in
his neighborhood. Probably, he thought he could
operate without fear of discovery in this out-of-the-way
neighborhood, and it&#8217;s a shock to him to find
we are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some such thoughts were passing through Higginbotham&#8217;s
mind. How could he get rid of these boys
without disclosing to them that his was a radio-controlled
plane?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very much obliged to you, gentlemen,&#8221; he
said, smoothly, &#8220;for coming to my aid. As it is,
however, I do not need help. This is a plane of my
own design, I may as well state, for I can see its
surprising lines have aroused your curiosity. I
would prefer that you do not come any closer but
that, on the other hand, you would leave me now.
I want to make some minor repairs, and then I shall
be able to fly again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; answered Bob composedly, climbing
back from the fusilage to his seat in the pit. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t want to annoy you. Good day.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, Frank swung clear, the propeller to
which Bob had given a twist began anew to revolve,
the plane taxied in a circle, then rose and started for
the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly surprised him,&#8221; chuckled Jack.
&#8220;He didn&#8217;t know what to say to us. In his excitement
and his fear of discovery of some secret or
other, he acted in a way to arouse suspicion, not
dispel it. Well, Frank, you win the gold medal.
Your hunch about Higginbotham being untrustworthy
certainly seems to have some foundation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say so, too,&#8221; agreed Bob. &#8220;But what do you
imagine happened to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob sat with the glasses trained backwards to
where the little plane still rode the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; answered Jack. &#8220;Something went
wrong at the secret radio plant and the continuity
of the dash which provides the juice for the plane&#8217;s
motor was broken. That&#8217;s the only way I can figure
it. I say. Let&#8217;s tune up to 1,375 meters, and see
whether that continuous dash is sounding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not there,&#8221; Bob announced presently. &#8220;Not
a sound in the receivers. Neither does the plane
show any signs of motion. Look here. Suppose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
that whatever has happened at that fellow&#8217;s radio
plant cannot be fixed up for a long period, what will
Higginbotham do? Ought we to go away and leave
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, doubtfully, &#8220;it does look heartless.
He&#8217;s four or five miles from shore. Of course,
we might shoot him a continuous dash from our own
radio plant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zowie,&#8221; shrieked Bob, snatching the receiver
from his head, and twisting the controls at the same
time, in order to reduce from the 1,375-meter wave
length. &#8220;There&#8217;s his power. No need for us to
worry now. Oh, boy, but wasn&#8217;t that a blast in the
ear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ruefully, he rubbed his tingling ears. Jack was
doing the same. Poor Frank, whose eardrums had
been subjected to the same shock, also had taken a
hand from the levers at the same time and snatched
off his headpiece.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s rising now,&#8221; cried Bob.</p>
<p>Without his headpiece, Frank could not hear the
words and kept his eyes to the fore, as he swung now
above the line of the shore. Jack, however, also
was straining his eyes to the rear, and he snatched
the glasses from Bob and trained them on the plane.</p>
<p>True enough, Higginbotham was rising.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>A CALL FROM HEADQUARTERS</h3>
</div>
<p>It was not yet five o&#8217;clock when, the airplane
safely stowed away and the doors of the hangar
closed and locked, the boys once more stood on the
skidway.</p>
<p>&#8220;What say to a plunge before we go up to the
house?&#8221; proposed Frank. &#8220;There&#8217;s nobody to see us.
We can strip down at the beach, splash around for
ten minutes, and then head home. It&#8217;s a hot, sticky
day and that trip to the city left me with the feeling
that I wanted to wash something away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others agreed to the proposal and they started
making their way to the shore, discussing the latest
turn of events on the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly looks as if your hunch about Higginbotham,
when we met him in his office, was
justified,&#8221; said Jack, clapping Frank on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boy&#8217;s a wonder,&#8221; agreed Bob. Then, more
seriously, he added:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But, I say. Higginbotham isn&#8217;t the man who flew
the radio-controlled plane before. I mean the fellow
whose tracks I found in the sand. That chap was
peg-legged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Jack. &#8220;And where does
Higginbotham figure in this matter, anyhow? It&#8217;s
some mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s see what we do know so far,&#8221; suggested
Frank. &#8220;It&#8217;s little enough that we have found
out. But I like mysteries. First of all, Bob finds
a secret radio plant, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; interrupted Jack. &#8220;First of all, I discover
interference in the receivers at a 1,375-meter wave
length.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;Well, second is
Bob&#8217;s find of the radio plant to which he is led by
tracks in the sand made by a peg-legged man. Look
here. Bob thought at the time that man had arrived
in a boat. He saw marks on the sand indicating a
boat had been pulled up on the shore. Might not
that have been the indentation made by the radio
plane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I was thinking to myself a minute
ago,&#8221; said Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; continued Frank, &#8220;we then discovered
the radio plane in Starfish Cove. From Uncle George
we learned a mysterious stranger had recently bought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
the Brownell place, the &#8216;haunted house,&#8217; and had
built a fence about the property and set armed guards
to keep out intruders. The plot was thickening all
the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>By now the boys had reached the shore and well
above the tide mark they began to strip, dropping
their clothes in heaps. Frank continued talking as
he shed his garments:</p>
<p>&#8220;So we decided to go up to the city and ask Mr.
McKay who it was had taken the Brownell place.
Instead of Mr. McKay we found his secretary, Higginbotham,
who professed to know nothing about the
matter. Yet, when we arrive down here, we find
Higginbotham in the radio plane, visiting a schooner
well off shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellows,&#8221; he added, as having dropped the
last article of clothing, he stood prepared to plunge
in; &#8220;that man Higginbotham must have left his
office immediately after we interviewed him, and
probably came down by motor car. We spent two
or three hours longer in the city, which gave him
the chance to beat us. Now what brought him down
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;There may be a big
liquor plot, and he may be in it. Probably, is. Perhaps
he was alarmed at our inquiries and hurried
down to keep things quiet for a while.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what he did, Bob, I do believe,&#8221; said
Jack, approvingly. &#8220;I believe you&#8217;ve hit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, come on,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have this
plunge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scooping up two handsful of wet sand he flung
it at his companions. Then the fight began.</p>
<p>Forty-five minutes later, as they strolled across the
lawn of the Temple home, Della came running to join
them from the tennis court where she was playing
with a girl visitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Some man
has been calling for the three of you on the telephone.
Two or three times in the last hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling for us, Sis?&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t given his
name. I believe he&#8217;s calling from New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys looked at each other, puzzled. Who
could it be?</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s Mary again,&#8221; said Della, pointing to
a maid who at that moment emerged on the side
veranda, overlooking the tennis court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister Robert, you&#8217;re wanted on the telephone,&#8221;
came the maid&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>Bob hurried indoors, Jack at his heels. Frank
hung behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Frank Merrick,&#8221; said Della pertly.
&#8220;Give an account of yourself, if you please. What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
were you boys doing in the city to-day? You think
you&#8217;re grand, don&#8217;t you, to go flying off in your
airplane, on the very day I invite a girl down here
to meet you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she good looking, Della?&#8221; asked Frank, anxiously.
&#8220;I won&#8217;t meet her if she isn&#8217;t good looking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Della realized he was merely teasing, but she made
a cruel thrust in return.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t expect a good looking girl to be interested
in you, do you?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Frank laughed, then reached out to seize her by
the shoulders, but she eluded his grasp and went
speeding off across the lawn with him in pursuit.
They reached the tennis court, laughing and flushed,
Della still in the lead. There Della beckoned the
other girl to them, and managed introductions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is that scatter-brained Frank Merrick, I
told you about, Pete,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Frank, this is my
own particular pal at Miss Sefton&#8217;s School, Marjorie
Faulkner, better known as Pete. If you can
beat her at tennis, you will have to play above your
usual form.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That so?&#8221; said Frank, entering into the spirit of
badinage. &#8220;Give me a racquet, and I&#8217;ll take you
both on for a set. About 6-0 ought to be right, with
me on the large end. Never saw a girl yet that could
play passable tennis.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You scalawag,&#8221; laughed Della. &#8220;When it was
only my playing that enabled us to beat Bob and
Jack last light. Well, here&#8217;s your racquet, all waiting
for you. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Della was a prophet. The slender, lithe Miss Faulkner,
with her tip-tilted nose, freckles, tan and all,
proved to be almost as good a player as Della herself.
The result was that, although both games were hotly
contested, Frank lost the first two of the set. He was
about to start serving for the third game, when Bob
and Jack, giving evidences of considerable excitement,
approached from the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Frank, come here,&#8221; called Bob.</p>
<p>Frank stood undecided, but Della called to her
brother:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a very busy boy, Bob. You and Jack better
come and help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noting the presence of the other girl, Bob and Jack
came forward, whereupon Della once more managed
introductions. Bob, usually rather embarrassed in
the presence of girls, seemed at once at ease, and
apparently forgot entirely his urgent business with
Frank. He and Miss Faulkner fell into the gay
chatter from which the others were excluded. Jack
seized the opportunity to pull Frank aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Something has happened
already. That call was from one of the government
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
prohibition enforcement agents up in New
York. He said Inspector Condon had carried our
information and surmises about our neighbors to
him immediately after seeing us. He&#8217;s coming down
to-night to the house. Said he thought he could
make the trip in about three hours, and would be
here at 9 o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;Has Uncle George
come home yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and he won&#8217;t be home. It seems he telephoned
earlier that he was running down to Philadelphia
on business for a day or two. He always
keeps a grip packed at his office, you know, for such
emergencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank nodded, then looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to be here, however,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well,
anyway, there&#8217;s your father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dad planned to stay in town to-night at his
club.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to handle this
alone. I suppose, however, this man just wants to
talk with us at first hand and, perhaps, by staying
until to-morrow, get an idea of what&#8217;s down here
for himself. He might even ask us to take him up
in the plane over the Brownell place, to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Bob say to him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Told him to come on down,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;What
else could he say? We had told Inspector Condon
that we placed ourselves at the government&#8217;s service.
I expect I had better put him up at our house overnight.
Then we won&#8217;t have to make any useless
explanations to Mrs. Temple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank nodded. Mrs. Temple, though kindly soul
enough, was so involved in social and club duties
that she had little time to give the boys. As a matter
of fact, Frank was not at all certain that she would
be at home for dinner that night. As to putting up
the stranger at Jack&#8217;s home, that would be an easy
matter. Jack&#8217;s mother was dead, and a housekeeper
managed the house and servants for himself and his
father. She was an amiable woman, and all Jack
would have to do would be to prefer a request that
a guest room be prepared, and it would be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Frank,&#8221; called Bob, interrupting their aside;
&#8220;see how this strikes you? Miss Faulkner and I
will play you and Della. We shall have time for
a set before dressing for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Righto,&#8221; agreed Frank, taking up his racquet,
while Jack sank to the turf bordering the court, to
look on.</p>
<p>Bob really outplayed himself, and several times,
when he approached Della, Frank whispered to her
that her brother was smitten and trying to &#8220;show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
off&#8221; before the new girl. Della, well pleased, nodded
agreement. Nevertheless, Frank and Della
played their best, and the score stood at three-all
when Jack hailed them from the sidelines with the
information that, unless they preferred being late to
dinner, it behooved them to quit playing and hasten
indoors. Dinner at the Temples was served promptly
at 7 o&#8217;clock, and never delayed. Accordingly, the
game was broken up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, Jack,&#8221; said Frank, linking an arm
in that of his pal; &#8220;your father&#8217;s not at home, and
we won&#8217;t let you dine in solitary splendor. You are
coming to dinner with us.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A CONSULTATION</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;This man Higginbotham is not the chief figure
in the liquor smuggling ring,&#8221; stated Captain Folsom
emphatically.</p>
<p>Captain Folsom sat in the Temple library, with
the boys grouped about him. The time was nearing
ten o&#8217;clock. From the moment of his arrival, shortly
after the hour of nine, he had been in conference
with the boys, and they had explained to him in detail
all that they had discovered or surmised about their
neighbors of the old Brownell place.</p>
<p>An army officer with a distinguished record, who
had lost his left arm in the Argonne, Captain Folsom
upon recovery had been given a responsible post
in the prohibition enforcement forces. His was a
roving commission. He was not attached permanently
to the New York office, but when violations of
the law at the metropolis became so flagrant as to
demand especial attention, he had been sent on from
Washington to assume command of a special squad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
of agents. Lieutenant Summers, U. S. N., in command
of the submarine division known as the &#8220;Dry
Fleet,&#8221; was operating in conjunction with him, he
had told the boys.</p>
<p>Still a young man in his early thirties, he had a
strong face, an athletic frame and a true grey eye,
and had made a good impression on the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he repeated emphatically, &#8220;this man Higginbotham
is not at the bottom of all this devilment.
There is somebody behind it all who is keeping utterly
in the dark, somebody who is manipulating all the
various bands of smugglers around this part of the
world. I believe that when we unearth him we shall
receive the surprise of our lives, for undoubtedly,
from certain evidences that have come to my attention
so far, he will prove to be a man of prominence
and importance in the business world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should such a man engage in liquor
smuggling?&#8221; asked Jack, astonished.</p>
<p>Captain Folsom smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;wherever &#8216;big money,&#8217;
so to speak, is involved, you will find men doing
things you would never have suspected they were
capable of. And certainly, &#8216;big money&#8217; is involved
in bootlegging, as liquor smuggling is termed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently, you boys have not been interested in
watching developments in this situation, since the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
country became &#8216;dry.&#8217; Well, it&#8217;s a long story, and
I won&#8217;t spin out the details. But, as soon as the
prohibition law went into effect, in every city in
the country bootleggers sprang up. Many, of course,
were of the lawless type that are always engaged in
breaking the laws. Others, however, were people
who ordinarily would not be regarded as law-violators.
In this case, though, they felt that an injustice
had been done, that human liberty had been violated,
in the foisting of prohibition on the country. They
felt it was a matter the individual should be permitted
to decide for himself, whether he should take a drink
of liquor or not, you know.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people, therefore, did not regard it as a
crime to break the law.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another salve to conscience, moreover, was the
fact that tremendous sums of money were to be made
out of bootlegging. Liquor was selling for prices
that were simply enormous. It still is, of course,
but I am speaking about the beginnings of things.
People who never had drunk liquor in any quantities
before, now would buy a case of whiskey or wine,
and pay $100 a case and up for it, and consider
themselves lucky to get it. They would boast quietly
to friends about having obtained a case of liquor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bootlegging industry, accordingly, has grown
to astonishing proportions to-day. Right in New
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
York City are men who are rated as millionaires, who
a few years ago did not have a penny, and they have
acquired their money through liquor smuggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;At first these bootleggers operated individually,
and elsewhere in the Nation that is still largely their
method. But here in New York there have been increasing
evidences lately that some organizing genius
had taken charge of the situation and was swiftly
bending other bootleggers to his will. For some time,
we have been of the opinion that a syndicate or ring,
probably controlled and directed by one man, was
responsible for most of the liquor smuggling here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you believe,&#8221; interrupted Frank, &#8220;that
this man who has bought the old Brownell place
may be that central figure?&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is entirely possible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Moreover, what
you have told me about the construction of a secret
radio plant, and about the appearance of this radio-controlled
airplane, fits in with certain other facts
which have puzzled us a good deal lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;For one thing,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, &#8220;my colleague,
Lieutenant Summers of the submarine division,
tells me that his radio receivers aboard the
boats of his fleet have picked up any number of
mysterious series of dots and dashes lately. Code
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
experts have been working on them, but they have
proved meaningless.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was puzzled by them. He still is puzzled.
But, we have noticed that after every such flooding
of the ether with these dots and dashes, a shipment of
liquor has appeared on the market. And one theory
advanced is that the liquor was landed along the
coast of Long Island or New Jersey in boats controlled
by radio from a powerful land station. The
boats, of course, according to this theory, were
launched from some liquor-laden vessel which had
arrived off the coast from the West Indies. Radio-driven
boats, automobiles or planes, Lieutenant Summers
tells me, are directed by a series of dots and
dashes. So you see, our theory sounds plausible
enough, and, if it is correct, the direction probably
has come from this secret radio station.&#8221;</p>
<p>Big Bob&#8217;s brow was wrinkled in thought. He
seldom spoke, but usually when he did so, it was to
the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what would be the necessity
for this radio-driven airplane? Apparently, the
airplane is for communication from ship to shore.
But, with a radio land station, why can&#8217;t such communications
be carried on by radio in code?&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something in that,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, these plotters are playing safe,&#8221; suggested
Frank. &#8220;They may figure that code would be
intercepted and interpreted. Therefore, they confine
their use of radio to the transmission of power
waves, and do not employ it for sending messages.
The airplane is the messenger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;Frank&#8217;s idea is a good one.
Besides, by using a radio-controlled plane, the plotters
can scout over the surrounding waters for miles
whenever a ship is about to land a cargo. The plane
can make a scouting expedition over the shore, too,
for that matter. You see a radio-controlled plane has
an immense advantage for such scout work, inasmuch
as it proceeds practically without noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom slapped his knee resoundingly
with an open palm.</p>
<p>&#8220;By George,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I believe you boys have
hit it. This scout plane is the answer to what has
puzzled us the last few weeks. We know liquor is
being landed somewhere from ships, but despite our
best efforts both ashore and on the water, we have
been unable to run down the smuggling ships or the
receiving parties ashore. Well, this plane warns the
ships away from the vicinity of the sub chasers, and
also directs the landing of the radio-controlled boats
with their cargo at lonely spots where there are no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
guards. Yes, sir, I believe that is the way it has been
worked.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fell silent, and sat with brow wrinkled in concentrated
thought. The boys respected his silence,
and also were busied with their own thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one thing that has got to be done,&#8221; said
Captain Folsom, presently.</p>
<p>There was a gleam of determination in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the radio-controlled plane must be
put out of commission?&#8221; asked Frank quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have read my thought,&#8221; accused Captain
Folsom. &#8220;Yes, that is just what I was going to
suggest. But how to do it, with no evidence against
Higginbotham or this mysterious individual living
at the Brownell house, is beyond me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack&#8217;s a shark at the use of radio,&#8221; declared
Bob. &#8220;Perhaps he can suggest some method.&#8221;</p>
<p>All turned toward Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do, of course, to make a raid and
capture the plane and their radio plant?&#8221; Jack asked.</p>
<p>Captain Folsom shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t do, for a number
of reasons. In the first place, as I said, we have no
evidence that would stand in court that Higginbotham
or anybody else connected with the matter
is a law-breaker. It may even be that whoever is
behind the plot has obtained a government license
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
for the operation of the radio station. The power
of these bootleggers reaches far, and goes into high
places. Therefore, we cannot afford to make an
open attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, in the second place,&#8221; he added, leaning forward
and uncrossing his legs; &#8220;what good would
that do? It would only warn the Man Higher Up
that we were on his track. We don&#8217;t want him
warned. We want to close in on him. For I do
believe you boys have given us a lead that will enable
us to do so. At the same time&mdash;we do want to put
that plane out of commission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Jack, suddenly. &#8220;It&#8217;s strange,
if with our airplane and our own radio plant, one
of the most powerful private plants in the world,
certainly in America, it&#8217;s strange, I say, if with this
equipment we are not enabled to work out some
method for accomplishing your ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, let&#8217;s think it over. Let&#8217;s sleep on it. I have
the glimmerings of an idea now. But I&#8217;m tired. It&#8217;s
been a hard day. Suppose we all turn in and talk
it over to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea, Jack,&#8221; declared Bob, yawning unrestrainedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m tired, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Captain Folsom. &#8220;Meanwhile,
I shall have to take advantage of your kind offer to
put me up for the night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble at all,&#8221; said Jack, heartily. &#8220;Come
along. Night, fellows. Come over to my house
after breakfast. Night.&#8221;</p>
<p>With mutual farewells the party broke up, Frank
and Bob retiring to their rooms, and Jack and his
guest starting to make their way to the Hampton
home. On the part of none of them was there any
prevision of the strange events the night would bring
forth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE ENEMY STRIKES</h3>
</div>
<p>In the middle of the night, Jack awoke with a
start, and lay silent a moment, listening, wondering
what had aroused him. The next moment he heard
a cry outside his window of &#8220;Jack, Jack, wake up.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Frank&#8217;s voice. Leaping from bed, Jack
sprang to the upflung window overlooking the side
lawn nearest the Temple house. Outside in the
moonlight stood Frank, a pair of trousers pulled over
his pajamas, hands cupped to his mouth. He was
preparing to yell again.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; called Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hangar&#8217;s afire. Tom Barnum saw the blaze
from your radio station and called the house. I&#8217;m
off. Come as fast as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning, Frank plunged away toward the airplane
hangar, clutching at his trousers as he ran. Jack
could not help laughing a little at the ridiculous spectacle
which his chum provided. Then he turned back
to the room and started feverishly to dress, ignoring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
everything except trousers, shirt and shoes. While
he was thus engaged, the voice of Captain Folsom
hailed him sleepily from next room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You up, old man? Thought I heard voices. Anything
the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there is,&#8221; replied Jack, going to the communicating
door. &#8220;Tom Barnum, the mechanic-watchman
in charge of our radio plant, which isn&#8217;t
far from the Temples&#8217; airplane hangar, says the latter
is afire. Frank and Bob already are on the way
down, and stopped to warn me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Afire?&#8221; cried Captain Folsom, leaping from his
bed, and reaching for his trousers. &#8220;That&#8217;s bad.
Just when we need the airplane, too, to spy on these
rascals. Half a minute, old man, and I&#8217;ll be with
you. Not so devilish easy to get into trousers with
one arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I help you?&#8221; proffered Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;m all fixed.
Here, let me lace your shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you insist,&#8221; said Captain Folsom.</p>
<p>As Jack deftly laced up the other&#8217;s shoes, he said
in an anxious tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think, sir, those people set the fire? It
would be a catastrophe if the plane burned just at this
particular time, wouldn&#8217;t it? There. All ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty good of you,&#8221; said Captain Folsom.
&#8220;Lead on, then, and I&#8217;ll follow. As to the fire, I&#8217;ll reserve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
opinion until I get the facts. But these liquor
smugglers are unscrupulous, and if they feared the
airplane was being used against them, they would
have no compunctions about burning it.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the side of the house on which their rooms
were located, Jack and his guest were unable to see
anything of the fire, as the hangar lay in an opposite
direction. But the moment they emerged outdoors,
the blaze showed dully against the sky above an intervening
grove of trees.</p>
<p>Without wasting breath in further speculation,
Jack and Captain Folsom started running for the
scene. The hangar stood a considerable distance
away, and so fast had they covered the ground that
they arrived pretty well blown.</p>
<p>They found the airplane standing like a singed
bird on the sands in front of the hangar, and gathered
about were Frank and Bob, Tom Barnum, and
Old Davey, Mr. Hampton&#8217;s gardener.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wings are gone, Jack,&#8221; said Bob, turning as
his chum approached. &#8220;But, thanks to Tom&#8217;s rapid
work with the extinguisher, the fire did not reach
the tank, and the old bus will be able to fly again after
she sprouts new wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack turned his gaze to the hangar. The sides and
roof were of corrugated iron. Practically the only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
wood in the construction was that employed in the
skidway. It needed only a glance to tell him the
latter had been torn up and piled inside the hangar
where it was still smouldering.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>There were excited answers from all, but presently
the story was made clear. Some miscreant apparently
had forced open the doors of the hangar, torn up
the wooden planks and flooring of the skidway, piled
them inside and then set them afire. Probably whoever
was guilty employed this method in order to
give himself time to escape before the fire should
attract attention. He had overlooked, however, the
presence of a large tank of chemicals with which to
fight fire stored at the rear of the hangar, and Tom
Barnum, after telephoning the Temple home, had
appeared so quickly at the hangar that, by employing
the chemical extinguisher, he had managed to
save the airplane from being blown up. Old Davey,
a light sleeper, had hurried over from his cottage
and the pair were in the act of pushing apart the
burning brands in order to wheel out the plane, when
Bob and Frank arrived to help them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Et&#8217;s mighty cur&#8217;ous,&#8221; said Old Davey, shaking
his head dolefully; &#8220;mighty cur&#8217;ous, the trouble you
boys hev with thet airyplane. D&#8217;ye think now et was
them Mexicans comin&#8217; back?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, Davey,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Not this time. Some
other set of rascals was responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he mean, may I ask?&#8221; inquired Captain
Folsom, his curiosity aroused.</p>
<p>Briefly, Jack related to him how the previous summer
two representatives of a faction of Mexican
bandits engaged in making war on a group of independent
oil operators headed by his father in New
Mexico, had appeared at the quiet Long Island home,
stolen the airplane, and flown with it to Old Mexico
where they had employed it in kidnapping Mr. Hampton.
The boys, said Jack, not only had effected
Mr. Hampton&#8217;s release but also had recovered the
plane, as related in &#8220;The Radio Boys On The Mexican
Border.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too long a story to be told now, however,&#8221;
he concluded, after giving the above bare outline.
&#8220;Some other time I&#8217;ll give you the details if you are
interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly am interested,&#8221; said Captain Folsom,
regarding Jack with increased respect. &#8220;To think
of you boys having done all that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was fun,&#8221; said Jack hastily, embarrassed
by the other&#8217;s praise. &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s see what the
fellows are doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others proved to be engaged in spraying the
last of the chemical on the expiring embers of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
blaze, and in stamping and beating out the last of
the fire. As the light died out, Bob fumbled for
and found the switch in the hangar and the electric
lights sprang on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever did this made a hurried job of it,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I wonder&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was just wondering why the job was left
uncompleted? Tom,&#8221; he added, turning to Tom
Barnum; &#8220;how big was the blaze when you saw it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; much,&#8221; answered the other, his round,
good-natured face shining through a fog of pipe
smoke. &#8220;I was restless. Somethin&#8217; I et for dinner,
I guess. So I got up to smoke a pipe an&#8217; stroll
around outside the station a bit, to see if I couldn&#8217;t
get myself sleepy. My room&#8217;s back o&#8217; the power
house, ye know. Well, as I come outside I see a light
over here. Not much bigger than a flashlight. But it
was 2 o&#8217;clock in the mornin&#8217; an&#8217; I knew none o&#8217; you
could be there. So I thinks either that&#8217;s fire or some
rascal, an&#8217; telephoned you, then hustled over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;That explains it. I was
wondering why whoever set this fire didn&#8217;t make a
more complete job of it, but I see now. You probably
scared him away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;He might a heard me
callin&#8217; to Old Davey as I run past his cottage.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;let&#8217;s push the bus inside.
She&#8217;s not much good till we get new wings, but we
don&#8217;t want to leave it out here all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>All lent a hand, and then as he started to swing
shut the doors Bob examined the lock and gave an
exclamation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even broken open,&#8221; he said, disgustedly. &#8220;I
must have forgotten to lock up when we left. Good
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time, he fastened the lock, and then fell in
with his comrades and the party started for their
homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever did that wasn&#8217;t far away,&#8221; Captain
Folsom said, thoughtfully. &#8220;If we had made a
search we might have gotten some trace of him.
But it is too late now. I imagine, of course, as I
said to Mr. Hampton here earlier, that our bootlegger
friends set the fire. When they discovered
your airplane in their neighborhood, they feared it
would interfere with their plans and decided to get
rid of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they got rid of it, all right,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;for
to-night, anyhow, as well as for some time come.&#8221;</p>
<p>They proceeded in gloomy silence for the most
part, although the voice of Old Davey, an incorrigible
conversationalist, floated back to them from
where he led the way with Tom Barnum. Where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
their courses diverged, the pair waited for them to
call &#8220;Good nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Jack suddenly, to his companions as
Tom and Old Davey departed; &#8220;I have an idea.
Let&#8217;s go over to the radio station, just for luck, and
listen in on the ether to see whether we can pick up
the interference on the 1,375-meter wave length.
Maybe, we can get some of those dots and dashes,
too, of which Captain Folsom spoke. It&#8217;s only a
step or two out of our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob yawned sleepily but stumbled ahead for the
station, without a word, and Frank fell in with him.
Jack called to Tom Barnum and ran ahead, leaving
Captain Folsom to proceed with his chums.</p>
<p>When the others arrived, the door of the station&#8217;s
transmitting room stood open, the lights were turned
on, and Jack already was seated at the instrument
table, a headpiece clamping the receivers to his ears
while he manipulated the tuner.</p>
<p>Bob slumped down on the outside step, and Frank
took a seat beside him, with an arm flung over his
shoulders. The damage to their airplane was felt
keenly by both. Captain Folsom, with a pitying
glance at them, entered the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put on that headpiece,&#8221; said Jack, motioning.</p>
<p>The other complied.</p>
<p>&#8220;By George,&#8221; he cried, a moment later.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT EXPEDITION</h3>
</div>
<p>For several minutes Jack and Captain Folsom
listened with strained attention while through the
receivers came to their ears a series of dots and
dashes which to one corresponded exactly with the
similar sounds picked up by the prohibition enforcement
officials on other occasions, and which to the
other were meaningless and, therefore, significant.</p>
<p>That statement is not difficult to explain. Jack
was familiar with the Morse and Continental codes.
What he heard in the receivers represented neither.
Therefore, either the station he had picked up and
was listening-in on was sending in some mysterious
code or, as was more likely, it was radiating control.
And, all things considered, the latter was the more
likely supposition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bob and Frank, unaware of what was
forward, sat disconsolately on the stoop outside in
the warm night air, glooming over the damage to
their airplane.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>Finally Captain Folsom took off the headpiece
and, seeing that Jack had done likewise, turned to
him with an air of exasperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is maddening,&#8221; he declared to Jack. &#8220;Evidently,
if I know anything about it, the smugglers
are landing liquor somewhere along the coast by
means of a radio-controlled boat or boats.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what I think?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I believe
they are landing the liquor somewhere near us.
For one thing, the sounds in the receivers are very
clear and distinct. That, however, does not portend
a great deal. The night is exceptionally good for
sending, clear and with practically no static. But
there is another thing to be considered, and it&#8217;s
that I have in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Captain Folsom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thinking of the attempt to destroy the airplane,
and the probable reason for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; continued Jack, &#8220;if the smugglers
planned to operate to-night, and were made fearful
by recent events that we either had learned anything
about them or suspected them, they might decide it
would be unwise to have us at large, so to speak.
Suppose we were to swoop down on them in our airplane,
they might think, what then? This man Higginbotham,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
now. He might not have been deceived
by our explanation of how we came to be on hand
when he was flying in his radio-controlled plane and
fell into the water. Besides, and this is the biggest
point of all, we had appeared at his office to try and
find out who had bought the Brownell property.
Oh, the more I consider it, the more I realize that
he could not help but suspect that we were on the
track of the liquor smugglers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sound sense, all of it,&#8221; he declared; &#8220;especially,
your deduction that they are landing liquor near us.
Look here,&#8221; he added, with sudden resolution;
&#8220;where does that man, Tom Barnum, sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has quarters opening from the power house
here,&#8221; said Jack, in a tone of surprise. &#8220;Why, may
I ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think so well of your supposition that I
want to do a bit of investigating. Barnum looks like a
stout, reliant man. Besides, he knows the neighborhood.
I&#8217;ll ask him to accompany me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s eyes glittered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with us?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t think of drawing you boys into
this. It might involve some little danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;danger would be nothing new
to us. If you do not actually forbid our accompanying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
you, we&#8217;ll go along. I&#8217;m keen to go. And I
can say the same for Bob and Frank without questioning
them. Besides, you must remember it was
their airplane which these rascals damaged. They&#8217;ll
be eager for a chance to even scores.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom still looked dubious.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are unarmed,&#8221; he objected. &#8220;And we might,
just might, you know, stumble into a situation where
we would need to protect ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, if that&#8217;s all that stands in your way,&#8221; said
Jack, rising, &#8220;you need not worry. Tom Barnum
keeps a whole armory of weapons here. He has at
least a half dozen pistols and automatics. As for us,
we are all pretty fair shots and used to handling
weapons. Now, look here, Captain Folsom,&#8221; he
said, pleadingly, advancing and laying a hand on the
other&#8217;s arm; &#8220;I know what you are saying to yourself.
You are saying how foolish it would be for
you to encumber yourself with three harum-scarum
boys. But that is where you make a mistake. We
have been through a lot of dangerous situations, all
three of us and, I can tell you, we have been forced
to learn to keep our wits about us. I can promise
you that we would not be a hindrance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom&#8217;s face cleared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said he, heartily; &#8220;spoken like a man.
I&#8217;ll be only too glad to have you fellows.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take Tom Barnum, too,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;He
can be relied on in any crisis. Wait here until I
stir him up and tell the boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving the other, Jack went outside and apprised
his chums of the new plan. It was just the
thing they needed to rouse them from the despondency
into which contemplation of the damage to
their airplane had thrown them. Then he went to
Tom Barnum&#8217;s quarters. Tom had not yet returned
to sleep. He was eager to join in the adventure.
Bringing three or four pistols, Jack and Tom quickly
rejoined the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your idea, Captain Folsom?&#8221; Jack inquired,
when all were ready to depart and everything
had been made tight about the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, how far is it to Starfish Cove?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Between two and three miles,&#8221; answered Bob.
&#8220;But the tide is out, and we shall have good going
on the hard sand, and ought to make it under forced
draught in a half hour or a little more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any other place where small boats might
land conveniently, any other place reasonably near?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys and Tom Barnum shook their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s far and away the best place,&#8221; said Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I propose that we make our way
close to the Cove, and then take to the cover of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
trees, which you have given me to understand, come
down there close to the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They fringe the beach,&#8221; Bob explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. With reasonable care we ought to be
able to make our way undiscovered close enough to
see what is going on, supposing a landing such as I
have in mind is taking place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s armed guards on the Brownell place
nowadays,&#8221; interjected Tom Barnum, to whom Jack
had given a brief explanation of things. &#8220;Maybe,
them fellers have sentries posted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have to exercise caution when we get
close to the Cove,&#8221; said Captain Folsom. &#8220;And now,
if we are all ready, let us start. Every second&#8217;s delay
is so much time lost. They&#8217;ll be working fast. If
we are to gain any information, we must hasten
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Righto,&#8221; said Bob, striding off. &#8220;And just let
me get my hands on the sneak that tried to burn the
airplane,&#8221; he added, vindictively. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give that
gentleman a remembrance or two of the occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others fell in, and with long strides started
making their way along the sand left hard-packed
by the receding tide, under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Bob set a terrific pace but, fortunately, all members
of the party were young men and accustomed to
physical exercise, and none found it any hardship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
to keep up with their pacemaker. On the contrary,
three at least enjoyed the expedition and found their
spirits uplifted by the zest of this unexpected adventure
undertaken at 2 o&#8217;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>When they drew near the first of the two horns
enclosing the little bay known as Starfish Cove, Bob
pulled up, and the others came to a halt around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just ahead there,&#8221; said Bob, pointing, and addressing
Captain Folsom, &#8220;lies our destination. I
expect it would not be wise to make our way any
farther along the sands.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. We&#8217;ll take to those trees up yonder.
I&#8217;ll go first with Jack.&#8221; Unconsciously, he had taken
to addressing the boys by their given names. &#8220;Do
you others keep close behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this order they started making their way
through the grove, just inside the outer belt of trees.
The moonlight was bright on the water and the
sands, and illuminated the aisles of the grove in
fairylike fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep low and take advantage of cover,&#8221; whispered
Captain Folsom, as he saw how the matter
stood. And crouching and darting from tree to
tree, they worked their way forward until a low
exclamation from Jack halted his companion who
was a bit behind him. The others came up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fence,&#8221; whispered Jack, succinctly.</p>
<p>Sure enough. There it was, just ahead, a high
wire fence, the strands barbed and strung taut on
steel poles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t see the Cove yet from here,&#8221; whispered
Jack. &#8220;Our first glimpse of it won&#8217;t come until we
move forward a bit farther. We&#8217;ll either have to
try to climb over this or go out on the beach to
get around it. It doesn&#8217;t go down to the water, does
it, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and I didn&#8217;t see it when I was here several
days ago,&#8221; Bob replied in a low voice. &#8220;I suppose
it must have been here then, but I didn&#8217;t see it.
There was no fence on the beach, and I was following
the water&#8217;s edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big tree close to it,&#8221; said Frank, pointing.
&#8220;And, look. There&#8217;s a limb projects over the
fence. We might shin up the tree and out on that
limb and drop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I couldn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Captain Folsom,
simply. &#8220;This arm&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot,&#8221; said the sensitive Frank, with
quick compunction, silently reproaching himself for
thus reminding the other of his loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sensitive,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, and
added grimly: &#8220;Besides, the German that took it,
paid with his life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>There was an awkward silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; said Jack, breaking it, &#8220;it would be
ticklish work for any of us to get over that fence
by climbing the tree. The fence is a good ten feet
high, and the strands of barbed wire curve forward
at the top. That limb, besides, is twelve feet or more
from the ground, and not very strong, either. It
looks as if we would have to make our way around
the fence and out on the beach.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, then,&#8221; said Bob, impatiently. &#8220;Now
that I&#8217;m here I want a look at Starfish Cove. I have
one of Frank&#8217;s hunches that there is something
doing there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started moving forward toward the edge of
the grove, which here was out of sight, being some
distance away, as Jack had led the way well within
the shelter of the trees because of the radiance cast
by the moon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Bob, wait,&#8221; whispered Frank, suddenly,
in a tense voice, and he restrained his companion.
&#8220;I heard something.&#8221;</p>
<p>All crouched down, listening with strained attention.</p>
<p>In a moment the sound of voices engaged in low
conversation came to their ears, and a moment later
two forms appeared on the opposite side of the fence,
moving in their direction.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>PRISONERS</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I heard a fellow shouting and beat it, or I&#8217;d&#8217;a done
a better job. Anyhow, that&#8217;s one plane won&#8217;t
be able to fly for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the two men dropped this remark as the
pair, engrossed in conversation, passed abreast of
the party on the outside of the boundary fence and
not ten feet from them. The speaker was a short,
broad, powerfully built man in appearance, and he
spoke in a harsh voice and with a twang that marked
him as a ruffian of the city slums. He wore a cap,
pulled so low over his features as to make them indistinguishable.
And he walked with a peg leg!</p>
<p>The moonlight was full on the face of the other,
and the boys recognized him as Higginbotham.
There was an angry growl from Bob, farthest along
the line toward the beach, which he quickly smothered.
Apparently, it did not attract attention, for
Higginbotham and his companion continued on their
way oblivious to the proximity of the others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The young hounds,&#8221; said Higginbotham, in his
cultivated, rather high voice. And he spoke with
some heat. &#8220;This will teach them a lesson not to
go prying into other people&#8217;s business.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man made some reply, but it was indistinguishable
to those in hiding, and the precious
pair proceeded on their way, now out of earshot.
But enough had been overheard. It was plain now,
if it had not been before, where lay the guilt for the
attempt to destroy the airplane. Plain, too, was the
fact that Higginbotham was engaged in some nefarious
enterprise.</p>
<p>For several seconds longer, after Higginbotham
and his companion had gotten beyond earshot and
were lost to view among the trees, Jack remained
quiet but inwardly a-boil. Then he turned to Captain
Folsom and Tom Barnum, crouching beside
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What an outrage,&#8221; he whispered, indignantly.
&#8220;Poor Bob and Frank. To have their airplane damaged
just because that scoundrel thought we were
prying into his dirty secrets. I wish I had my hands
on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly his tone took on a note of alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where are Bob and Frank?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;They were here a moment ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared about him in bewilderment. The others
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
did likewise. But the two mentioned could not be
seen. With an exclamation, Jack rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Bob decided to go
for the fellow who burned his plane and take it out
of his hide. When that boy gets angry, he wants
action.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started striding hastily down toward the beach,
alongside the wire fencing. The others pressed at
his heels. Presently, they caught the glint of water
through the trees, and then, some distance ahead,
caught sight of two figures moving out from the
grove onto the sands on the opposite side of the
fence. Jack increased his pace, but even as he did
so two other figures stole from the woods on the
heels of the first pair.</p>
<p>Involuntarily, Jack cried out. The second pair
leaped upon the backs of the first and bore them to
the ground. The next moment, the air was filled
with curses, and the four figures rolled on the sands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows,&#8221; cried Jack, breaking into a
run, and dashed ahead.</p>
<p>He broke from the trees and discovered the boundary
fence came to an abrupt end at the edge of the
grove. It was here Bob and Frank, he felt sure,
had made their way and leaped on Higginbotham
and the thug. For so he interpreted what he had
seen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>As he came up the fight ended. It had been bitter
but short. Frank was astride Higginbotham and
pressing his opponent&#8217;s face into the sand to smother
his outcries. Bob had wrapped his arms and legs
about the city ruffian and the latter, whose curses
had split the air, lay face uppermost, his features
showing contorted in the moonlight. Bob knelt upon
him. As Jack ran up, he was saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to be careful whose airplane you
burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>An exclamation from Captain Folsom drew Jack&#8217;s
attention from the figures in the immediate foreground,
and raising his eyes he gazed in the direction
in which the other was pointing. Some fifty
yards away, on the edge of Starfish Cove, a half
dozen objects of strange shape and design were
drawn up on the sand. They were long, shaped
somewhat like torpedoes and gleamed wet in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>Not a soul was in sight. The moonlit stretch of
beach was empty except for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world can those be?&#8221; asked Captain
Folsom.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are made of metal,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;See how
the moonlight gleams upon them. By George, Captain,
they are big as whales. Can they be some type
of torpedo-shaped boat controlled by radio?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is luck,&#8221; exclaimed Captain Folsom.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just what they are. Probably, those two
scoundrels were coming down here to see whether
they had arrived, coming down here from their
radio station. Come on, let&#8217;s have a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started forward eagerly. Jack was a step behind
him. An inarticulate cry from Tom Barnum
smote Jack&#8217;s ears, and he spun about. The next
instant he saw a man almost upon him, swinging
for his head with a club. He tried to dodge, to
avoid the blow, but the club clipped him on the
side of the head and knocked him to the ground.
His senses reeled, and he struggled desperately to
rise, but to no avail. A confused sound of shouts
and cries and struggling filled his ears, then it seemed
as if a wave engulfed him, and he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>When he recovered his senses, Jack found himself
lying in darkness. He tried to move, but discovered
his hands and feet were tied. He lay quiet,
listening. A faint moan came to his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Jack?&#8221; came Frank&#8217;s voice in reply,
filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>It was close at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Where&#8217;s Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s here, but I&#8217;m worried about him. I can&#8217;t
get any sound from him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; asked Jack, his head buzzing,
and sore. &#8220;Where are the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess we&#8217;re all here, Mister Jack,&#8221; answered
Tom Barnum&#8217;s voice, out of the darkness. &#8220;Leastways,
Captain What&#8217;s-his-name&#8217;s here beside me,
but he don&#8217;t speak, neither.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens,&#8221; exclaimed Jack, in alarm, and
making a valiant effort to shake off his dizziness.
&#8220;Where are we? What happened? Frank, do you
know? Tom, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody jumped on me from behind,&#8221; said
Frank, &#8220;and then the fellow I was sitting on, this
Higginbotham, squirmed around and took a hand,
and I got the worst of it, and was hustled off to the
old Brownell house and thrown in this dark room.
I had my hands full and couldn&#8217;t see what was going
on. I heard Tom yell, but at the same time this
fellow jumped on me. That&#8217;s all I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a dozen or more of &#8217;em come out of
the woods,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;They sneaked out. We
was pretty close to the trees. I just happened to
look back, an&#8217; they was on us. Didn&#8217;t even have
time to pull my pistol. They just bowled me over
by weight of numbers. Like Mister Frank, I had
my own troubles and couldn&#8217;t see what happened to
the rest of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a momentary silence, broken by Jack.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy to see what happened,&#8221; he said, bitterly.
&#8220;What fools we were. Those things on the beach
were radio-controlled boats which had brought liquor
ashore, and a gang was engaged in carrying it up to
the Brownell house. We happened along when the
beach was clear, and Higginbotham and that other
scoundrel were the vanguard of the returning party.
When they shouted on being attacked by you and
Bob, and Frank, the rest who were behind them in the
woods were given the alarm, sneaked up quietly, and
bagged us all. A pretty mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>A groan from Bob interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Bob,&#8221; said Jack, contritely, for he had
been blaming the headstrong fellow in his thoughts
for having caused their difficulties by his precipitate
attack on Higginbotham. &#8220;He seems to have gotten
the worst of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Jack,&#8221; said Frank suddenly. &#8220;My
hands and feet are tied, and I suppose yours are, too.
I&#8217;m going to roll over toward you, and do you try
to open the knots on my hands with your teeth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would if I could, Frank,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;But that
clip I got on the side of my head must have loosened
all my teeth. They ache like sixty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then I&#8217;ll try my jaws on your bonds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, Frank was alongside Jack in the darkness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here, where are your hands?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>After some squirming about, Frank found what he
sought, and began to chew and pull at the ropes
binding Jack&#8217;s hands. It was a tedious process at
first, but presently he managed to get the knot sufficiently
loosened to permit of his obtaining a good
purchase, and then, in a trice, the ropes fell away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick now, Jack,&#8221; he said, anxiously. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
know how long we&#8217;ll be left undisturbed. Somebody
may come along any minute. Untie your feet and
then free Tom and me, and we can see how Bob and
Captain Folsom are fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack worked with feverish haste. After taking
the bonds from his ankles, he undid those binding
Frank. The latter immediately went to the side of
Bob, whose groans had given way to long, shuddering
sighs that indicated a gradual restoration of consciousness
but that also increased the alarm of his
comrades regarding his condition.</p>
<p>Tom Barnum next was freed and at once set to
work to perform a similar task for Captain Folsom,
who meantime had regained his senses and apparently
was injured no more severely than Jack, having
like him received a clout on the side of the head.
Tom explained the situation while untying him.
Fortunately, the bonds in all cases had been only
hastily tied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, this is Frank. Do you hear me? Frank.&#8221;
The latter repeated anxiously, several times, in the
ear of his comrade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank?&#8221; said Bob, thickly, at last. &#8220;Oh, my
head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank heaven, you&#8217;re alive,&#8221; said Frank fervently,
and there was a bit of tremolo in his tone. He and
the big fellow were very close to each other. &#8220;Now
just lie quiet, and I&#8217;ll explain where you are and
what happened. But first tell me are you hurt any
place other than your head?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think not,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But the old bean&#8217;s
humming like a top. What happened, anyhow?
Where are we? Where are the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here, old thing,&#8221; said Jack, on the other
side of the prone figure.</p>
<p>Thereupon Bob, too, was put in possession of the
facts as to what had occurred. At the end of the
recital, he sat up, albeit with an effort, for his head
felt, as he described it, &#8220;like Fourth of July night&mdash;and
no safe and sane Fourth, at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you fellows can ever forgive me,&#8221;
he said, with a groan. &#8220;I got you into this. I saw
red, when I discovered it was Higginbotham and
that other rascal who had set the plane afire. There
they were, in the woods, and I set out to crawl after
them. Frank followed me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tried to stop him,&#8221; interposed Frank. &#8220;But he
wouldn&#8217;t be stopped. I didn&#8217;t dare call to the rest
of you for fear of giving the alarm, so I went along.
Anyhow, Bob,&#8221; he added, loyally, &#8220;I felt just the
same way you did about it, and you were no worse
than I.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;You weren&#8217;t to blame at all.
It was all my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Let&#8217;s consider what to
do now? Here we are, five of us, and now that we
are on guard we ought to be able to give a pretty
good account of ourselves. I, for one, don&#8217;t propose
to sit around and wait for our captors to dispose
of us. How about the rest of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say on, Jack,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;If Bob&#8217;s all right,
nothing matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have something in mind, Hampton, I believe,&#8221;
said Captain Folsom, quietly. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE WINDOWLESS ROOM</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I have no plan,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;except this: We
have freed ourselves of our bonds, and we ought to
make an effort to escape. And, if we can make our
escape,&#8221; he added, determinedly, &#8220;I, for one, am
anxious to try to turn the tables.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn the tables, Jack?&#8221; exclaimed Frank. &#8220;What
do you mean? How could we do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could capture the smugglers&#8217; radio plant,&#8221;
Jack suggested, &#8220;and call help, we could catch these
fellows in the act. Of course, I know, there is
only a slim chance that we could get immediate aid
in this isolated spot. But I&#8217;ve been thinking of that
possibility. Do you suppose any boats of the &#8216;Dry
Navy&#8217; about which you spoke are in the vicinity,
Captain Folsom?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the darkness, the latter could be heard to stir
and move closer. All five, as a matter of fact, had
drawn together and spoke in whispers that were
barely audible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is a bully idea, Hampton,&#8221; said Captain
Folsom, with quickened interest. &#8220;Yes, I am certain
one or more of Lieutenant Summers&#8217;s fleet of sub
chasers is along this stretch of coast. From Montauk
Point to Great South Bay, he told me recently, he
intended to set a watch at sea for smugglers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Then, if we can gain
possession of the smugglers&#8217; radio plant and call help,
we may be able to catch these fellows and make a
big haul. For, I presume, they must be bringing a
big shipment of liquor ashore now. And, as the
night is far advanced, doubtless they will keep it
here until, say, to-morrow night, when they would
plan to send it to the city in trucks. Don&#8217;t you
fellows imagine that is about what their plan of
procedure would be?&#8221;</p>
<p>All signified approval in some fashion or other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first step, of course,&#8221; said Captain Folsom,
&#8220;must be to gain our freedom from the house. Are
any of you familiar with the interior? Also, has
anybody got any matches? My service pistol has
been taken, and I presume you fellows also have
been searched and deprived of your weapons?&#8221;</p>
<p>General affirmation followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But about matches? Will you please search your
pockets, everybody?&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys never carried matches, being nonsmokers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Tom Barnum, however, not only produced
a paper packet of matches but, what was far
more valuable at the moment, a flashlight of flat,
peculiar shape which he carried in a vest pocket
and which his captors had overlooked in their hurried
search. He flashed it once, and discovered it was in
good working order.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far, so good,&#8221; said Captain Folsom. &#8220;Now
to discover the extent of our injuries, before we
proceed any further. Mine aren&#8217;t enough to keep me
out of any fighting. How about the rest of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank&#8217;s been binding up my head with the tail
of my shirt,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But I guess he could do
a better job if he received a flash from that light
of yours, Tom. Just throw it over here on my head,
will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom complied, and it was seen Bob had received
a nasty wound which had laid the scalp open on the
left side three or four inches. The cut had bled
profusely. With the light to work by, Frank, who
like his companions was proficient in first aid treatment
of injuries, shredded a piece of the white shirting
for lint, made a compress, and then bound the
whole thing tightly. Jack&#8217;s blow was not so serious,
but Frank bound his head, too.</p>
<p>None of the boys nor Tom Barnum ever had been
inside the Brownell house before, although all were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
more or less familiar with its outer appearance. Tom
now made a careless survey of the room by the aid
of his flashlight. He would flash it on for only a
moment, as he moved about soundlessly, having removed
his shoes, and he so hid the rays under his
coat that very little light showed. This he did in
order to prevent as much as possible any rays falling
through cracks in the walls or floor, and betraying
their activity.</p>
<p>The room, Tom found on completing his survey,
was without windows and possessed of only one
door, a massive oaken affair with great strap iron
hinges and set in a ponderous frame. From the
slope of the ceiling at the sides, he judged the
room was under the roof. Walls and ceiling were
plastered.</p>
<p>Not a sound had penetrated into the room from the
outside, or from the other parts of the house, and
at this all had marveled earlier. Tom&#8217;s report of the
survey supplied an answer to the mystery. There
was little chance for sound to penetrate within.</p>
<p>&#8220;But a room without windows?&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;How,
then, does it happen the air is fresh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a draught from up above,&#8221; answered
Tom. &#8220;I cain&#8217;t see any skylight, but there may be
an air port back in the angle of the roof tree. Say,
Mister Jack, this room gives me the creeps,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
added, his voice involuntarily taking on an awed tone.
&#8220;A room without windows. An&#8217; over in the far corner
I found some rusted iron rings fastened to big
staples set deep into a post in the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What, Tom? You don&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, siree. Ol&#8217; Brownell, the pirate whaler&#8217;s,
been dead for a long time. But there&#8217;s queer stories
still around these parts about him an&#8217; his house;
stories not only &#8217;bout how he was killed finally by
the men as he&#8217;d cheated, but also &#8217;bout a mysterious
figure in white that used to be seen on the roof, an&#8217;
yells heard comin&#8217; from here. You know what?&#8221;
He leaned closer, and still further lowered his voice.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet this room was a cell fer some crazy body an&#8217;
ol&#8217; Brownell kept him or her chained up when violent.
Some people still say, you know, as how that white
figure wa&#8217;n&#8217;t a ghost but the ol&#8217; man&#8217;s crazy wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brrr.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank shivered in mock terror and grinned in the
darkness. &#8220;Some place to be,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, light though he made of Tom&#8217;s story,
the hour, the circumstances in which they found
themselves, the mystery of the windowless room, all
combined to inspire in him an uncanny feeling, as if
unseen hands were reaching for him from the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting out is still our first consideration,&#8221; Captain
Folsom said. &#8220;What Barnum reports makes it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
look difficult, but let&#8217;s see. Have you tried the door?
Is it locked?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tried it?&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t possible. There
ain&#8217;t neither handle nor knob inside, to pull on. No
lock nor keyhole in it, neither. Must be barred on
the outside. That&#8217;s another reason for thinkin&#8217; it was
built for a prison cell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if the old pirate kept a crazy woman in here
when she was violent,&#8221; supplied Jack, &#8220;you can bet
he built the walls thick to smother her yells. That&#8217;s
why we hear no sounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a time. Each was busy with
his own thoughts. The prospect, indeed, looked dark.
How could they escape from a cell such as this?</p>
<p>Jack was first to break the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said he, &#8220;fresh air is admitted into
this room in some fashion, and, probably, as Tom
surmised, through an air port in the ceiling. It may
be the old pirate even built a trap door in the roof.
Obviously, anyhow, our best and, in fact, our only
chance to escape lies through the roof. It may be
possible to break through there, whereas we couldn&#8217;t
get through walls or the door. Let&#8217;s investigate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eager whispers approved the proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Tom,&#8221; Jack continued, &#8220;we&#8217;ll investigate
that angle in the roof tree. You brace yourself
against the wall, and I&#8217;ll stand on your shoulders.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>The two moved away with the others close behind
them. Jack mounted on Tom Barnum&#8217;s shoulders.
He found the ceiling sloped up to a lofty peak. Running
his hands up each slope, he could discern no
irregularity. But, suddenly, nearing the top, where
the sides drew together, he felt a strong draught of
air on his hands.</p>
<p>Their positions at the time were this: Tom was
leaning against the end wall, with Jack on his
shoulders, and facing the wall. The ceiling sloped
upward on each side and it was up these slopes Jack
had been running his hands. Tall as he was, and
standing upright, his head still was some feet from
the roof tree above, where the sloping sidewalls
joined.</p>
<p>When he felt the inrush of air on his hands, which
were then above his head, Jack reached forward. He
encountered no wall at all. But, about a foot above
his head, instead, his fingers encountered the edge of
an opening in the end wall and under the roof tree.
Trembling with excitement, he felt along the edge
from side wall to side wall, and found the opening
was more than two feet across.</p>
<p>Not a word had been said, meanwhile, not a whisper
uttered. Now, leaning down, and in a voice
barely audible, Jack whispered to the anxious group
at his feet:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fellows, there&#8217;s an opening up here under the
roof tree. I can&#8217;t tell yet what it is, but if you hand
me up Tom&#8217;s flashlight I&#8217;ll have a look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank passed the little electric torch upward, flashing
it once to aid Jack in locating it in the darkness.
Again Jack straightened up carefully. Holding the
flat little flashlight between his teeth, he gripped the
edge of the opening and chinned himself. Then,
holding on with one hand, with the other he manipulated
the flashlight.</p>
<p>One glance was sufficient. It revealed a tunnel-like
passage under the roof tree. This passage was
triangular in shape, with the beam of the roof tree
at the peak, the sloping, unplastered sides of the roof
and a flat, solid floor. It extended some distance
forward, apparently, for the rays of the flashlight did
not reveal any wall across it. The floor was solidly
planked, probably a yard wide, instead of two feet-plus
of Jack&#8217;s original estimate, and the height from
floor to roof tree was all of two and a half feet.</p>
<p>Laying down the flashlight, Jack drew himself
over the edge of the opening. Then, moving cautiously
forward in the darkness, not daring to throw
the light ahead of him for fear of betraying his
presence, he crawled on hands and knees. The
draught of air through the passageway was strong,
and he had not proceeded far before he saw ahead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
faint bars across the passage, not of light but of
lesser darkness.</p>
<p>He decided there was some opening at the end of
the passage, but could not imagine what it might be.
When he came up to it, however, the solution was
simple. Immediately under the peak of the roof tree,
in a side wall, was an opening in which was set a
slatted shutter. This admitted air, yet kept rain
from beating in.</p>
<p>And in a flash, Jack realized to what ingenious
lengths the original owner of the house had gone in
order to provide for his prisoner a cell that would
be virtually soundproof, yet have a supply of fresh
air. So high, too, was the opening of the passage
in the cell that one person could not reach it unaided.</p>
<p>Jubilant at his discovery and with a plan for putting
it to use as a means of escape, Jack, unable to
turn about in the narrow passage, worked his way
backward until the projection of his feet into emptiness
warned him he had reached the room. Then he
let himself down and, when once more with his companions,
explained the nature of his discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can lift that shutter out,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and
swing upward to the roof tree. There is a cupola, an
old-fashioned cupola, on this house, as I remember it.
Once we are on the roof, we can work our way to
that cupola and probably find a trapdoor leading down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
into the house. If we decide that is too dangerous,
we may be able to slide down the gutters. Anyhow,
once we are in the outer air and on the roof, we&#8217;ll
be in a better position than here. Come on. I&#8217;ll go
up first, and then help Captain Folsom up. Do the
rest of you follow, and, as Frank is the lightest, he
ought to come last. The last man will have to be
pulled up with our belts, as he will have nobody to
stand on.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE TABLES TURNED</h3>
</div>
<p>Negotiation of the entrance of all into the passageway
was made without accident, Tom Barnum
staying until next to last and then, with a number of
belts buckled together, aiding Frank to gain the opening.
Meanwhile Jack, who was in the lead, found
on closer investigation that the slatted shutter obscuring
the air port was on hinges and caught with a
rusted latch. To open the latch and unhinge the
shutter and then, by turning it sideways, pull it back
into the passageway and place it noiselessly on the
floor, was a comparatively simple matter.</p>
<p>Whispering to Captain Folsom, next in line, to pass
the word along that all should stay in the passageway
while he investigated the situation outside, Jack
squirmed partway through the opening, faced upward,
took a good clutch on the shingled edge of the
rooftree and gradually drew his body out and over
the edge of the roof. When, finally, he lay extended
on the roof, clutching the saddle for support, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
of the opinion that Captain Folsom with only one
arm to aid him, certainly could not negotiate the
exit in similar fashion, and examined the shingles
to see whether they could be torn up sufficiently to
admit of his friends climbing through.</p>
<p>The moon shone brilliantly. On that side of the
house were no lights in any windows. No sounds
of any human activity came to him. The house was
large, with numerous gables that prevented Jack
from seeing seaward.</p>
<p>Leaning over the edge of the roof, he called in a
low voice to Captain Folsom who looked up from
the little window. Jack told him to wait, and explained
he was going to try to rip off a number of
shingles.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the crosspieces to which the shingles are
nailed are close together,&#8221; Captain Folsom objected.
&#8220;They are too close to permit of our crawling
through. And, while they are light and might be
broken, yet we would make considerable noise doing
so and might give the alarm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack considered a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;But, if I break off
the shingles around the peak of the roof, here at the
very end, you will have a better chance to climb out,
then, because you will have the exposed crosspieces
to cling to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>Working rapidly, Jack managed to remove a patch
of shingles over a space of several square feet, in
short order. By the exercise of extreme caution, he
was enabled to complete the work without making
other than very slight noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said, speaking through the bars made
by the crosspieces, &#8220;come ahead, Captain. Put your
head backward out of the window, and place your
hand just where I tell you. I shall hook my feet
under these crosspieces to brace myself. That will
leave both hands free to aid you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom followed directions, and with Jack
lending his support, he managed to gain the roof.
Then Bob, Tom Barnum and Frank followed in quick
succession. To make room for them, Jack and
Captain Folsom had worked their way along the
rooftree, which was not the main rooftree of the
house, they had discovered, but that of one of the
side gables, with which, as Jack phrased it, &#8220;the house
was all cluttered up.&#8221;</p>
<p>This particular rooftree was blocked ahead by the
cupola, to which Jack earlier had referred. It was
a square, truncated tower with a breast-high wooden
balustrade around it. Jack climbed up this balustrade,
and Captain Folsom, with Bob aiding him
from the rear and Jack giving him a hand in front,
followed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Then, while the others were clambering up, Jack
cast a quick look around from this eminence. He
found, however, that the trees of the grove cut off
any view of the beach. But he was enabled to see
the grill-like towers of the radio station some distance
to the left of the house. With satisfaction, he
noted not a light was shown, and apparently the
place was deserted.</p>
<p>Still not a sound of human activity of any sort
reached him, and Jack was puzzled. Had their captors
departed, and left them bound, in that apparently
impregnable cell, to die? He could not believe
it. No, surely they were not to be killed. Either the
house was to be abandoned by the smugglers, and
their friends and families would be notified where to
find them, or else, the smugglers intended to return
for them presently.</p>
<p>If this latter supposition were correct, then,
thought Jack, it behooved him to act quickly. For,
if the smugglers returned and found they had escaped
from the cell, there would be only one conclusion to
draw as to their method of escape, and that would
be the right one.</p>
<p>Bending down, he saw at once in the bright moonlight
the outlines of a big trapdoor under his feet.
A ringbolt at one edge showed how it was raised.
Seizing it in a firm grip, Jack started to raise the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
trap. His heart beat suffocatingly. What would he
find underneath?</p>
<p>An inch at a time Jack raised the trap, while the
others knelt at the sides, peering through the growing
opening. Only darkness met their gaze, and the
smell of hot air imprisoned in a closed house came
out like a blast from a furnace door. The hinges,
apparently long unused and rusted, creaked alarmingly
despite all the care Jack exercised. But not a
sound came up from below.</p>
<p>At length Jack threw back the door, and the bright
moonlight pouring down the opening in a flood of
silver revealed a narrow, ladder-like stairway descending
to an uncarpeted hall. Jack started down
with the others at his heels.</p>
<p>In the hall he paused, to once more accustom his
eyes to the dimness which now, however, was not
impenetrable, as in their cell, because of the moonlight.
Presently he was able to make out a long hall
with only two doors breaking the double expanse of
wall. One door, on the right, was massive and over
it was a huge iron bar in a socket.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the door to the cell they had us in,&#8221; said
Frank, with conviction, as they stood grouped before
it. &#8220;Brrr. We&#8217;d have had a fine chance to break
that down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leading the way and walking on the balls of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
feet, shoes in hand, Jack moved forward to the other
door and had just laid his hand on the knob and was
about to turn it, when he heard voices on the other
side and the sound of footsteps mounting upward.</p>
<p>His mind worked lightning-fast in this crisis. It
was the door of a stairway leading to the lower part
of the house. Somebody was ascending it, not one
man but several. They could have only one purpose.
There was only one room up here on this upper
floor&mdash;the cell. Therefore, whoever was coming up
intended to visit them, thinking they still were in
that room.</p>
<p>These thoughts flashed through Jack&#8217;s mind in
less time than it took a man to mount a step. And,
as quickly, he thought of a plan. Turning to his companions,
he whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, get back to the cupola stairs, Frank, because
you&#8217;re nearest. Then run up and lower the
trapdoor, and crouch outside until I call you. The
rest of us can crouch down in this little space beyond
the door, and we&#8217;ll be hidden by it when the door
swings open.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank was off on noiseless feet, while the other
four huddled into the space indicated by Jack. By
the time the men mounting the stairs swung the
door inward, Frank had succeeded in gaining the
cupola. The noise made by the rusted hinges, as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
trap was lowered was covered up by the voices of the
men.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they did not close the stair door, but
left it standing open, thus hiding the four behind it.
There were three in the party, judging by the sound
of voices and footsteps, and one at least carried a
powerful electric flashlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought I heard a scratching sound,&#8221; said a
voice, which Jack and Bob recognized as that of
Higginbotham. &#8220;But I guess it was made by mice.
This old house is filled with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few steps farther along the party paused, and
Jack, looking from his hiding place, saw three figures,
shadowy and indistinct, before the huge door of the
cell, upon which one man had thrown the light, while
another was fumbling at the bar. The door swung
open, and the three walked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; whispered Jack.</p>
<p>Not waiting for the others, realizing it would be
only a moment or two before their disappearance
from the cell would be discovered, he leaped from
hiding, tore down the little hall like a whirlwind,
dashed against the great door and swung it into
place. Bob, who was close at his heels, dropped the
iron bar into place.</p>
<p>They were not a moment too soon. Shouts of
amazement and alarm came from the room even as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
the door was swinging shut. And hardly had Bob
dropped the bar into the socket than those within
threw themselves against the door. So tremendously
thick and strong was the latter, however, that with
its closing all sound from within was reduced to the
merest whisper. As for trying to move it, as well
attempt to push an elephant over by hand. This
those within must have realized, for presently they
desisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got &#8217;em in their own cage,&#8221; said Jack, triumphantly.
And, pulling from his pocket Tom Barnum&#8217;s
little flashlight, he reassured himself the door
really was barred, then mounting the stairway
thumped on the trapdoor as a signal to Frank. The
latter at once raised the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on down, Frank,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;There were
three of them, and we penned them in the cell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hastily he explained what had occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, fellows,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see who else is
downstairs. Let&#8217;s see if we can&#8217;t get out of here, so
we can radio Lieutenant Summers for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about leaving these chaps behind, Jack?&#8221;
protested Bob. &#8220;They can get out the same way we
did, and give the alarm. What we want to do is to
bring Lieutenant Summers to the scene without
letting these rascals get an inkling of what&#8217;s hanging
over them. If Higginbotham and his companions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
escape, he&#8217;ll start a search for us, and our plans will
stand a fair chance of being spoiled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Bob,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;But what can
we do? They can&#8217;t get out of there in a minute.
It will take them some time because, for one reason,
they will be fearful of our lying in wait for them,
perhaps. Meantime, we can be moving fast. Captain
Folsom,&#8221; he added, deferring to the older man,
&#8220;what do you think we ought to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the latter laid his sound arm on Jack&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he cautioned.</p>
<p>Muffled, but distinct, there came an outbreak of
pistol shots, followed by shouts faintly heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I feared,&#8221; said Captain Folsom. &#8220;They
are out on the roof already, and shooting and calling
to attract help. Come. We have no time to lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fumbling his way along the dark hall toward the
stair door, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Hampton, with your light. I can&#8217;t find
the knob. Ah&#8221;&mdash;as the light of the little torch
winked on&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s better.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled the door open, and started down the
stairs, Jack at his shoulder and flashing the light
ahead. The others crowded at their heels.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THROUGH THE TUNNEL</h3>
</div>
<p>At the foot of the stairway was another door, and
this stood open. It gave upon another hallway, carpeted
richly, and dim, yet not so dark but what Captain
Folsom could see his way. This faint illumination
came up a great open stairway from a wide and
deep living room below into which descended another
stairway at the far end of the hall.</p>
<p>A male voice, not unmusical, singing a rousing
chorus in Italian, and peering circumspectly through
an open balustrade into that lower room, Captain
Folsom saw the singer seated at a great square piano,
a giant of a man with a huge shock of dark brown
hair and ferocious mustaches, while a coal black
negro, even huger in size, lolled negligently at one
end of the keyboard, his red lips parted wide in a
grin of enjoyment and ivory white teeth showing
between, and at the other end of the piano, with his
elbows planted on the instrument and his head
pressed between his hands, stood or rather leaned a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
rough-looking man of medium height, his grizzled
hair all awry where he had run his fingers through
it, and wearing a khaki shirt open at the throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sing that again, Pete. What d&#8217;ye call it? The
Bull Fighter Song, hey? Well, I don&#8217;t know much
about music, but that gits under my skin. Come
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man called Pete was about to comply, and the
Negro was nodding his head in violent approval,
when the door from the outside gallery was burst
open unceremoniously, and a villainous looking individual
whirled into the room in a state of great
excitement. Others were behind him but, evidently
not daring to venture within, stood grouped in the
open doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Mike, wot d&#8217;ye mean, comin&#8217; in like this?
Into a gentleman&#8217;s house, too. Don&#8217;t ye know any
better, ye scut?&#8221; demanded the first speaker, he who
had asked for a repetition of the song.</p>
<p>Evidently, thought Captain Folsom, here was the
leader, for the other deferred to him, although it
was apparent he was a privileged character.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, now, Paddy Ryan,&#8221; said the man called
Mike; &#8220;ah, now, Paddy Ryan, sure an&#8217; I know &#8217;tis a
gentleman&#8217;s house since you rule it. But do them fellers
on the roof know it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellers on the roof?&#8221; said Ryan, advancing a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
step, threateningly. &#8220;Mike, ye been drinkin&#8217; again.
An&#8217; the night&#8217;s work not done yet. Out on ye, ye&mdash;ye&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Mike, holding up a hand. &#8220;Listen.
&#8217;Tis all I ask. Sure an&#8217; wid Pete caterwaulin&#8217;, &#8217;tis
no wonder at all ye cannot hear wot&#8217;s goin&#8217; on.
Hear the shootin&#8217; now, don&#8217;t ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>As if he were a magician calling the demonstration
into being at command, the shooting and shouting
of the trio on the roof, which for the moment had
died down, was now violently renewed. Ryan&#8217;s
lower jaw dropped open grotesquely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now will ye believe me?&#8221; demanded Mike,
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who is it?&#8221; asked Ryan, still in the grip
of his astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;How should we know?&#8221; asked Mike. &#8220;We was
comin&#8217; up from the beach wid another cargo o&#8217; the
stuff when we hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistuh Higginbotham went up to de roof wid
two men,&#8221; interposed the gigantic negro. &#8220;Leastways,
he done went up to see &#8217;bout dem prisonahs
an&#8217; ax &#8217;em a few quistions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, George,&#8221; said Ryan. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten.
Listen to that. There they go again.
Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He darted for the outer door, the negro George,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
Pete and Mike at his heels. The crowd of mixed
whites and blacks in the doorway gave &#8217;way before
him. In a trice they all were gone. The room was
deserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is our chance,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, to the
three boys and Tom Barnum, crouching beside him.
&#8220;Come on. We must get downstairs and out of the
house before they return, for return they will as
soon as they understand what the fellows on the roof
have to tell of our mysterious disappearance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He darted down the stairs, two at a time, with
the four others close behind him. Halfway across
the big room, however, he halted abruptly and
groaned:</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late. They&#8217;re coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; cried Jack, seizing him by an arm, and
pushing him along. &#8220;Quick, fellows, through this
door. It&#8217;s a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack had observed a closed door, near the piano,
and the others followed pell-mell behind him and
Captain Folsom. Frank, the last to enter, closed the
door and, finding his hand encounter a key, turned it
in the lock.</p>
<p>None too soon. They could hear shouts and
curses, as the mob surged up the stairway.</p>
<p>Jack, meanwhile, had been flashing Tom&#8217;s torch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
about and, discovering a wall switch, had pressed a
button. At once an electric light in the ceiling
flashed on, revealing that they were in a large pantry.
Bottles of liquor stood about and, on a tray, were a
number of sandwiches.</p>
<p>&#8220;That black butler was preparing to feed his boss,&#8221;
surmised Frank. &#8220;Well, those chicken sandwiches
look all right. I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to have one. Hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>And without more ado, Frank took a sandwich
and began eating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you, come on,&#8221; called Jack, smiling a little,
nevertheless, despite his anxiety. &#8220;Think of eating
at a time like this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Frank, polishing off the first
sandwich and taking another. &#8220;Well, lead on, Macduff.
Where you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way out of this except by the cellar,&#8221;
Jack replied, already having opened the other door of
the pantry and shot the rays of his searchlight down
the stairway. &#8220;Shall we try it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; answered Captain Folsom.
&#8220;They&#8217;re searching the rooms above us right now,
by the sound of it. Soon they&#8217;ll be down here. And
we can&#8217;t go out through the living room, because
I&#8217;ve withdrawn the key and peeped through the keyhole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
in the door and can see two men on guard at
the foot of the stairway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Barnum up to this moment had had little to
say. Now, however, he came forward with a remark
that caused the others to stare in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s said to be a secret passage from the
cellar to Starfish Cove or thereabouts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; about it, but that&#8217;s what folks
say. They say as how old Pirate Brownell was
afraid his sins would catch up with him some day,
and hoped to escape by the passage when the avengers
came. He couldn&#8217;t do it, however. He wasn&#8217;t
quick enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A secret passage?&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Come on. Last
man closes the cellar door and locks it from the
inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank was the last to go. Before quitting the
pantry, he stuffed the remaining sandwiches into his
trousers pockets, seized on a tremendous butcher
knife which was lying on the butler&#8217;s cabinet, and
switched off the light. Then he locked the cellar
stairway door, and descended to where the others
awaited him at the foot.</p>
<p>They stood, as well as they could discern, in the
midst of a huge cellar piled high with cases upon
cases of bottles and barrels, too.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whew,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, &#8220;this looks like a
bonded liquor warehouse. If we could only raid
this place right now, it would be the richest haul in
the history of the country since the nation went
dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is all this liquor?&#8221; asked Frank, incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, pulling a bottle from
the nearest case and examining the label critically.
&#8220;And it&#8217;s the genuine stuff, too. Brought in from
the Bahamas. English and Scotch whiskey.&#8221;</p>
<p>Louder shouts overhead and the noise of many
feet descending stairs warned them the pursuit had
drawn to the ground floor, and that they were in
momentary danger of discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those two doors won&#8217;t hold long,&#8221; said Jack,
anxiously. &#8220;If we can&#8217;t find that tunnel entrance,
we are out of luck. I think myself, we had better
look for a door to the outside and try to escape
that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, Tom Barnum&#8217;s voice, low but
tense and thrilling with excitement, came out of the
darkness ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister Jack, Mister Jack, come here. Here
where ye see my light.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others had not missed Tom before. But
immediately on reaching the cellar, he had gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
exploring by the light of the matches he had found
in his pockets, without troubling Jack for the
flashlight.</p>
<p>Hurriedly, the others now made their way to
where a dim gleam of light which went out before
they reached it only to be succeeded by another,
showed where Tom was awaiting them. When they
reached his side, they found him crouched at the
foot of a wall, pushing and straining at a big barrel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lend a hand,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;The entrance is
back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost over their heads on the floor above, an
attack was made at this moment on the door connecting
living room and pantry. They could hear
the shouts to surrender, to unlock the door, and the
blows being rained upon the barrier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Push. It&#8217;s a-movin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The barrel did move aside sufficiently to admit of
a man getting between it and the wall, and in the
rays of the flashlight appeared a small, door-like
opening in the stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;In with ye, every one,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;ll pile a
couple o&#8217; these cases on top of each other to cover
up the entrance, an&#8217; climb over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door above, the first of the two impeding
pursuit, fell with a splintering crash. There was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
shout of triumph, giving way to surprise when the
pantry was found untenanted. Captain Folsom and
the boys without more delay crawled into the opening.
They could hear Tom piling cases over the
entrance, then a thud as, having climbed his barricade,
he dropped to the cellar floor on the inside.
Then he joined them.</p>
<p>Once more, Jack called the precious flashlight into
play, and all could see they stood in a narrow, brick-walled
tunnel, with a vaulted roof above. It was
some four feet high, preventing them from standing
upright, and the walls were a yard apart. The next
moment the flashlight flickered and died.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Burned out. Now we are
ditched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, resolutely.
&#8220;Barnum, how many matches have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About a dozen left in this packet,&#8221; answered
Tom&#8217;s voice in the darkness. &#8220;But they&#8217;re them
paper things the cigar companies give away. Got
&#8217;em the other day when I was to the village. They&#8217;re
not much good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re better than nothing,&#8221; answered the captain.
&#8220;They were good enough to enable you to
find this tunnel. Come, there&#8217;s no need to despair.
I&#8217;ve got some matches myself, big ones. I&#8217;ll give
them to you, and do you lead the way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Striking a match, he located Tom behind him.
Handing him a dozen big matches which he had
found in a trousers pocket, he pressed against the
wall to permit of Tom&#8217;s passing him. The others
did likewise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep right behind me an&#8217; touchin&#8217; each other,&#8221;
said Tom. &#8220;I can feel the wall on each side with
my hands, an&#8217; so can the rest of ye as we go along.
I&#8217;ll save the matches till we need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without more ado, he set out, Jack, Bob, Frank
and Captain Folsom at his heels in the order mentioned.
They found that, despite the pitchy-black
darkness, they were able to make good progress, for
the narrow confines of the tunnel permitted of no
going astray. All kept listening with strained attention
for sounds of pursuit, but none came for so long
they began to feel more hopeful. Perhaps, their
pursuers did not know of the secret passage. No,
that was unlikely, inasmuch as one or other of the
smugglers must have seen the tunnel mouth when
he placed that barrel before it. Faint shouts from
the cellar came to their ears, indicating a search for
them was in progress there. The smugglers probably
would look to see whether they were hidden
among the barrels and cases, and not until that search
had been thoroughly prosecuted would they investigate
the tunnel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>These reflections were exchanged among them as
they proceeded. Suddenly the air, which had been
remarkably fresh, although earthy-smelling, became
cleaner. All felt they were approaching an exit.
The next moment Tom Barnum stumbled and fell
forward.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>RESCUE AT HAND</h3>
</div>
<p>For a moment Tom could be heard muttering
rueful exclamations as he caressed his bruises. Jack
who was next in line was trying to help him to his
feet. His foot, too, struck an obstruction which
caused him to lose balance. To avoid falling on
Tom, he put out his arms toward the walls. Instead
of meeting solid brickwork as before, however, he
felt his hands encounter crumbling earth. He
lurched forward, and his face was buried in a mass
of mould.</p>
<p>Spluttering and blowing, he scrabbled around
and his fingers closed over a root. It came away
in his clutch. The next moment a slide of earth
cascaded downward and Jack found himself leaning
against a bank of dirt, an uprooted bush in one hand,
and a patch of moonlight and sky overhead.</p>
<p>It was all clear. Where the tunnel approached
close to the surface, the roof and walls had caved in.
Tom had stumbled over this mound and fallen, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
Jack accidentally had torn away the screen of bushes
obscuring the hole above.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows,&#8221; he cried, delightedly, scrambling
upward, while Tom Barnum, who had regained
his feet and observed how the land lay, boosted him;
&#8220;come on, here&#8217;s a place to get out of the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quickly the others followed. They stood in the
midst of a grove of trees. Some distance to the
rear twinkled lights which indicated the location of
the Brownell house. No sounds of pursuit reached
them. But, stay. What was that? Captain Folsom
bent down, his ear close to the opening whence
they had climbed out and up to the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve found the tunnel, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They are coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we keep &#8217;em back here?&#8221; said Bob, unexpectedly.
&#8220;We can kick more dirt down into the
tunnel. And we can jump down and heave out a
lot of those fallen bricks, and so keep the gang back
when they arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we couldn&#8217;t keep up a defense like that forever,&#8221;
objected Jack. &#8220;Some of them would be
bound to go back through the tunnel, swing around,
and attack us from the rear. They have weapons,
and we haven&#8217;t. We&#8217;d be caught between two
fires.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob grunted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Guess you&#8217;re right. But I hate all this running
away. I&#8217;d like to take a crack at them. Never gave
me a fair chance the first time, jumping on me in
a gang, and when I had my back turned, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how you feel, Bob,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;But,
without weapons, run we must. And we had better
be quick about it now, too. They won&#8217;t be long
working through that tunnel, if they have lights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the shouts are growing closer,&#8221; said Captain
Folsom, bending down again to the hole. &#8220;But, look
here, Hampton, you make a run to that radio station
which I see above the trees there, to the right,
in that opening. We&#8217;ll stay here until they reach
the hole. Then we&#8217;ll batter them with bricks, and
flee to the left. That will create a diversion, and
give you a chance to try to raise Lieutenant
Summers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; grunted Bob, immediately dropping
into the hole and tossing out broken bricks from
the crumbling walls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them get too close to you,&#8221; warned
Jack. &#8220;They&#8217;re armed. And run toward home.
They won&#8217;t follow far. I&#8217;ll rejoin you somewhere
along the beach beyond the boundary fence, if you
wait for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait, if they don&#8217;t make us run too far,&#8221;
promised Captain Folsom. &#8220;In that case, make your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
way home. And if you cannot get Lieutenant Summers
by radio, don&#8217;t endanger yourself by delaying
too long around here. Now go.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a nod of understanding, Jack turned and
darted down the forest aisles toward the radio
station.</p>
<p>Who would he find there? He wondered. Or,
would the station be deserted? That it was in
working order, there was no doubt, for it was the
station&#8217;s issue of radio control to the liquor containers
offshore which they had overheard before
deciding to investigate.</p>
<p>Clutching the big butcher knife, the only weapon
in the party, which Frank had pressed into his hand
as he set out on his lonely mission, Jack dashed ahead
recklessly through the trees. The radio plant of the
smugglers burst full on his sight, as he came to the
edge of the trees fringing a little clearing. No
lights showed. Nevertheless, he paused to reconnoitre,
asking himself how best to approach it to
avoid discovery in case it should have an occupant.</p>
<p>As he stood there, a sudden outburst of shouts to
the rear, followed by a few revolver shots, warned
him the pursuers had reached the hole in the tunnel.
He hoped big Bob was controlling his recklessness,
and not running into danger. If his friends kept
down, there was no great danger of their being shot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
for only one man at a time could approach through
the tunnel and him they could pelt into retreat with
their bricks.</p>
<p>The shots ceased. The shouts died. Jack
grinned in satisfaction. The enemy had been halted.
Now, if his friends only utilized their opportunity to
hurry away before being attacked from the rear,
all would be well. He listened with strained attention.
No further sounds of combat reached him.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he had been examining the ground.
The moon was low down. What time had they left
home? Two o&#8217;clock? By the look of the moon
it must be near four now. That would be about
right. Although it seemed a lifetime, although an
excess of excitement had been crowded into that
period, still only about two hours had elapsed.</p>
<p>Having the door of the radio station in full view,
and observing no signs of life, as would have been
the case providing some one had been present, for
he would have been drawn to the door by this new
and closer outburst of fighting, Jack decided to
chance crossing the glade directly.</p>
<p>Darting ahead, he crouched listening, heard nothing,
then flung wide the door which opened outward
and sprang back. The moonlight fell full
inside a long bar of light. The sending room, at
least, was empty. Now for the power plant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>Jack entered, going warily, knife clutched in his
hand, despite his growing confidence that he had the
place to himself. There was a door at the rear.
Behind that must be the power plant. He set his
ear to the door. Only the low hum of a dynamo
came to his ears. He had expected that, for wiring
glimpsed outside the Brownell house and leading in
this direction through the trees had indicated the
house current was supplied from the power house
here. But was anyone in that other room, in
attendance?</p>
<p>There was a key in the connecting door. He
tried the handle softly. The door was locked.
Good. At least he would be safe from surprise from
that quarter. All the while, in order to guard
against surprise from the outside, he had been standing
sideways, one eye on the outer door. Now
something glimpsed there surprised an exclamation
from him.</p>
<p>It was not that anyone appeared in the doorway.
No, but offshore and not far distant a bright searchlight
suddenly cut athwart the night, putting the
moonlight to shame. It swung in a wide arc across
the sky and then came down to the shore and began
moving relentlessly along the beach.</p>
<p>He could not follow its movements fully. He
could not see whence it came. The grove of trees
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
intervening between the shore of Starfish Cove and
the radio plant cut off complete view. But a wild
hope leaped into his mind. Would the smugglers in
the liquor ship offshore be likely to show a light?
He did not consider it likely. Then, what sort of
ship was it probable the light came from?</p>
<p>&#8220;By George,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;maybe that&#8217;s a boat
of the &#8216;Dry Navy&#8217; already on the track of these
scoundrels.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood, gazing at that finger of light, spellbound.
What else could the ship be that would be
casting a searchlight along the shore, along this particular
stretch of shore of all places, and at this particular
time, what else could it be than a government
boat?</p>
<p>Breaking the spell that bound him, he sprang to
the instrument table, seized and adjusted a headpiece,
pulled a transmitter to him, threw over the
rheostat and adjusting the tuner to the 575 meter
wave length which Captain Folsom had told him
the government boats employed, he began calling.
What should he say if a government boat replied?
He decided on a plan of procedure.</p>
<p>Presently his receivers crackled, and he manipulated
the controls until the sputtering ceased, when
he heard a voice saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;U. S. Revenue Cutter Nark. Who is calling?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>Scarcely able to control his excitement at this
almost unbelievable good luck, Jack stammered in
reply. Then getting a grip on his emotions, he
replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking for Captain Folsom. Is Lieutenant
Summers aboard? Are you offshore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re offshore, all right,&#8221; answered his correspondent,
in a tone of the utmost surprise. &#8220;But
how in the world do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to speak to Lieutenant Summers,&#8221; answered
Jack, grinning to himself at the other&#8217;s
bewilderment. Even at this crucial moment, he
could not resist the temptation to mystify the other
a little. &#8220;As to knowing you&#8217;re offshore,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;I can see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See us? Say, this is too much for me. Wait
till I call Lieutenant Summers,&#8221; said the other.
&#8220;Did you say Captain Folsom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the name,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;Hurry, please.
This is a matter of life and death.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost at once another voice took up the conversation,
and from the tone of crisp authority, Jack
sensed it must be the officer he had asked for speaking.
Such, indeed, was the case. Lieutenant Summers
was aboard the Nark, directing operations, and,
as the radio room was in the chart house of the
cutter, he had intervened on hearing his operator
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
mention his own name and that of his colleague,
Captain Folsom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what&#8217;s this all about?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Is
Captain Folsom there? If so, put him on the
phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Lieutenant Summers, sir?&#8221; asked Jack,
respectfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. Who are you? Where are you calling
from? Where is Captain Folsom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not here,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;but I am speaking
for him. He&#8217;s in grave danger ashore. Moreover,
he wanted me to call for you, and if you are offshore
near Starfish Cove&mdash;that&#8217;s a little bay far down the
south shore of Long Island&mdash;and if it&#8217;s your ship
that is playing a searchlight on the beach, then it&#8217;s a
miracle, sir. I&#8217;ll try to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Briefly as possible, then, Jack detailed the necessary
facts for putting Lieutenant Summers in touch
with the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Lieutenant Summers, in conclusion;
&#8220;very good, indeed. We have received a tip liquor
was to be landed somewhere along this coast to-night,
and were scouting when you saw our light. It&#8217;s a
piece of luck, as you say. Do you think our searchlight
has been seen by these rascals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;although I don&#8217;t know.
Captain Folsom and my friends may have kept them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
so busily engaged, they had no time to keep a lookout
at sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll throw off the searchlight at once, anyhow.
We want no advertising. I&#8217;ll come in close
and land my boats. Can you be at the beach to
guide us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; replied Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. We&#8217;re about a mile offshore. We
should land in fifteen minutes. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack took off the headpiece, threw the rheostat
back to zero, and looked about him, as if dazed.</p>
<p>He could hardly believe his luck.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>BOB REDEEMS HIMSELF</h3>
</div>
<p>After Jack&#8217;s departure the group which he left
at the tunnel exit worked busily making what preparations
were possible to receive their pursuers.
Big Bob, who had jumped down into the opening,
kept tossing out bricks at a furious rate, and Frank
joined him and did likewise. Meanwhile, by the
light of his matches, aided by the moonlight, which
here in the woods, however, was not direct enough
to be of any great help, Tom Barnum investigated
the ground about the hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as the boys get out o&#8217; there,&#8221; he reported
to Captain Folsom, &#8220;we can all four of us kick down
enough dirt to block up the tunnel pretty well. The
earth is loose around here. That must&#8217;a been a recent
cave-in. By yanking up some o&#8217; these bushes
I already loosened the soil some more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, who had been
listening closely to the sounds coming through the
tunnel. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting too close for comfort. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
agree with you in believing this must have been a
recent cave-in. I believe it is unsuspected by the
enemy. They are coming along through that tunnel
and making plenty of noise, as if they expected to
have a considerable distance to go and fancied us
pretty far ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll give &#8217;em a surprise,&#8221; said Tom, grinning.
The watchman-mechanic of the Hampton radio plant
was still a young man. He had served in France.
And he was enjoying the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out now, Temple. And you, Merrick,&#8221;
said Captain Folsom, in a whisper. &#8220;To stay any
longer would be only to expose yourselves needlessly.
You have thrown out a lot of ammunition, as it is.
Besides,&#8221; he added, as he and Tom helped the others
climb to the surface, &#8220;we want to kick down this dirt
to block the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others followed Tom to the lip of the cave-in,
overhanging the tunnel, and, exercising care to avoid
tumbling in, succeeded in kicking down sufficient
earth to more than half fill the opening. Little more
than a foot of open space remained, after uprooted
bushes had been thrown down on top of the earth.</p>
<p>Working feverishly and in a silence broken only
by the dull sounds of the falling dirt, they had completed
their task when the nearer approach of voices
and of stumbling footfalls within the tunnel warned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
them to desist. Bob and Frank on one side of the
slight opening, Captain Folsom and Tom Barnum
on the other, they threw themselves prone on the
ground. The bricks had been divided into two piles,
one by the side of each pair.</p>
<p>They were none too soon. Barely had they taken
their positions when the first man of the pursuers,
proceeding without a light, stumbled against the
dirt they had kicked down, and fell forward into the
tangle of uprooted bushes. He let out a wild yell:</p>
<p>&#8220;Murder. Save me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob raised himself on one hand, craned forward,
took good aim at the hole, and let drive with a chunk
of broken brick. There was a crack, a howl of
anguish, succeeded by an outbreak of curses, as, following
Bob&#8217;s example, his companions also poured
in a fire of brickbats from each side.</p>
<p>Several scattered revolver shots rang out, but, as
all again had thrown themselves prone on the ground,
the bullets sped harmlessly overhead. After waiting
a moment, Bob again let drive with a piece of brick.
That his aim was good was attested by a howl of
anguish, succeeded this time not by more shots but
by a scurrying sound of retreat. Evidently, the one
or two men in the forefront had had enough, and
had withdrawn into the tunnel.</p>
<p>By holding their breath and listening intently, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
could, in fact, hear sounds of scuffling that indicated
a considerable number of men were within the tunnel
and were moving backward on each other to get
away from the danger zone.</p>
<p>Suddenly to Bob&#8217;s ears came the sound of a faint
groan, not a foot from his head, it seemed to him, as
he lay on the very edge of the hole, straining to listen.
It startled him, but at once he realized whence it came.
One of the pursuers, perhaps the man who had
stumbled first into their barricade, must have been
knocked out by a missile, and was coming to. Then
Bob had a wild idea.</p>
<p>Rising to his knees, he peered down into the hole,
descried a dark, round object just below him which
he took to be the head of a man, and bracing himself
with one arm, plunged the other into the hole.</p>
<p>Then, while Frank gasped and Tom Barnum swore
softly, from the opposite side, in wondering admiration,
the big fellow rose to his feet and with a mighty
tug pulled an inert body clear through the hole. One
look at the face was sufficient for identification despite
the blood streaming from an ugly gash over
the right temple. It was the man called Mike.
His eyelids were fluttering. He was recovering
consciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, some of you,&#8221; gasped Bob, retaining his
hold of the body, and holding the fellow up as a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
fisherman lifts up his catch to admire it; &#8220;search
him. Get his revolver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank sprang to obey, being the nearest. Running
his hands up and down the man&#8217;s body, he was
met only with disappointment. But then he felt something
bulky at the belt. It was a revolver in a
holster. Stripping off the weapon, he once more
ran his hands over the fellow&#8217;s body and, in a
trousers&#8217; pocket, found a handful of bullets, which
he abstracted.</p>
<p>Mike now began to squirm, and lash out with his
heels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got them?&#8221; gasped Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Frank. &#8220;Searched him twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then back with you, Mister Mike,&#8221; said Bob,
dropping the other back into the hole. &#8220;We want
no prisoners on our hands. And, listen,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve got your revolver. Just tell that to your
friends if they get inquisitive and want to follow
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A curse was his answer. Then they could hear
Mike start to scramble back through the tunnel, and
to call to his mates.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, &#8220;I want to tell
you that was one of the quickest bits of work I&#8217;ve
ever seen. You certainly have put a different complexion
on matters.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was just a bit of luck,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;When I heard him groan, it came to me all in a
flash what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; interrupted Frank, &#8220;thanks to Bob,
we have stalled off pursuit. Besides, we have a
revolver now. I don&#8217;t feel like running off and
leaving Jack. The way things have turned out, we
can get away without being discovered, anyhow, so
we wouldn&#8217;t be drawing anybody away from Jack&#8217;s
trail if we did go in the opposite direction. Let&#8217;s
run for it before they get a chance to circle back
through the tunnel and house, but head for the radio
station instead of home. What say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; said Captain Folsom. &#8220;You chaps certainly
know how to use your heads. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>And swinging about, he started running through
the trees in the direction taken by Jack a few short
minutes before.</p>
<p>They had not gone far, however, before another
volley of revolver shots broke out behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s at the tunnel again,&#8221; said Captain Folsom,
pausing to listen. &#8220;They must realize that we
wouldn&#8217;t stay there, so, although they will be cautious,
it won&#8217;t be long before they come out of the
tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;and some of them have gotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
out already, and are coming down from the
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>For, as he spoke, from farther back in the woods
bullets began to fly. The party from the house was
shooting as they came.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve seen us yet,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;The moon is pretty low down and these trees are
thick. Anyhow, they wouldn&#8217;t expect us to take
this course, as it is away from our home. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shrubbery was less dense now, thinning out,
as they neared the clearing in which the radio station
was located. Dashing ahead, they cleared the
last of the trees and started across the clearing. As
they drew nearer the station, heading for the doorway,
where the outward-swinging door stood open,
Jack saw the four figures in the moonlight and, believing
them foes, sprang up from the seat by the instrument
table, and dashed out to try to escape.</p>
<p>Running at top speed as he hit the sand, he started
in the opposite direction. Bob, however, had an advantage
Jack did not possess. He was looking for
Jack at the station, and was quick to recognize the
familiar figure. Jack, not expecting his friends
here, naturally considered the approaching figures
those of some of the smugglers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Jack, it&#8217;s us,&#8221; Bob called.</p>
<p>Jack knew that voice. There was no mistake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
He paused, dumbfounded, and spun about. Then
he started to retrace his steps. The others, pretty
well blown, slowed down their pace. As they approached,
Jack called:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t looking for you, and thought you some
of the other fellows. How did you happen to change
your plans and come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank started to explain.</p>
<p>But this was not time for explanations. Paddy
Ryan, heading a dozen of his men, had seen the
four fleeing through the woods and followed. At
this moment the pursuers reached the edge of the
clearing. The first intimation which any of the
five, engrossed in their meeting, had of the near
approach of the enemy, was an outburst of bullets,
some of which sang unpleasantly close while others
kicked up the sand around them. None, however,
took effect.</p>
<p>Where the others had come up with Jack was near
a corner of the radio plant. All leaped for cover
behind it. With a yell of triumph, Paddy Ryan
jumped out into the clearing, his men at his heels.</p>
<p>Frank, who carried the captured revolver and
spare ammunition taken from the man called Mike,
realized it was distinctly up to him to halt the enemy,
if possible. He did not want to shoot to kill,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
although he knew that the others had no such compunctions,
especially since Higginbotham must be
aware that if they escaped he would be a ruined man,
as they would be able to identify him. Nevertheless,
the emergency demanded action.</p>
<p>All this passed through his mind in a twinkling.
Then he peered out from behind the shelter of the
radio station, took deliberate aim, and fired. The
leading figure, that of Paddy Ryan, stumbled,
lurched forward and fell. Some of the others in
the pursuing party paused, others came on. Once
more Frank fired. A second man, the foremost,
fell. It was sufficient to deter the others. While
some ran back helter-skelter for the shelter of the
woods, others threw themselves prone in the sand,
and began to shoot from that position.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shot them in the legs,&#8221; said Frank.</p>
<p>His voice trembled. His legs felt weak, his hands
numb. It was with an effort he refrained from
dropping the revolver. Like his chums, Frank was
a crack shot, for Mr. Temple early had accustomed
them to the use of rifle and shotgun, and the previous
summer in New Mexico Tom Bodine, their cowboy
friend, had given all three valuable instructions in
revolver shooting. Nevertheless, to take deliberate
aim at a human being was unnerving. It was only
the realization that the safety of his comrades hung
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
on his aim that had nerved him to the task and
steeled his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, old thing,&#8221; said Bob, patting him on the
shoulder. Then, turning to Captain Folsom, he
added: &#8220;Well, captain, where do we go from here?
We&#8217;ve got all Long Island ahead of us. I expect
we had better start traveling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all, Bob,&#8221; said Jack, unexpectedly. &#8220;If
we can only hold these fellows off a few minutes
more, they&#8217;ll get the surprise of their lives. I raised
Lieutenant Summers by radio. He was close offshore
by the greatest of good luck. He&#8217;s sending
a landing party in boats, and I was to meet them at
the beach and act as guide.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>RESCUE ARRIVES</h3>
</div>
<p>Tom Barnum had disappeared. Now he ran up
from the rear of the radio station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Mister Frank, with that revolver,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They&#8217;ve split up an&#8217; the fellows in the woods are
trying to work their way around to take us in the
rear. I been watchin&#8217; from the back side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank nodded and started to follow. Then he
spun around, ran again to his former vantage point,
and sent a couple of bullets towards the figures in
the sand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll hold &#8217;em there for a minute,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As he ran after Tom Barnum to the other corner
of the station on the side which sheltered them, he
refilled the emptied chambers of the precious weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Tom Barnum, crouching low, and
pointing.</p>
<p>Frank tried to follow directions but saw nothing.
He pressed the revolver into Tom&#8217;s hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste time trying to show me,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;If you see anybody, shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom took the weapon, glanced along the barrel,
and pressed the trigger. A yell of pain was the response.
Twenty yards away there was a crash in
the bushes, then silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to the other corner,&#8221; said Tom, chuckling,
and dashed again to the post from which Frank
originally had fired.</p>
<p>Frank sat down, with his back against the wall of
the station and laughed hysterically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Golly, but this is a game of hide and seek, all
right,&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>Again the revolver spoke, a yell followed, and then
came a rain of bullets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come,&#8221; cried Tom, and in quick succession
he pumped out four more shots.</p>
<p>Howls and shrieks of anguish rose. Tom was
shooting with deadly intent. The attempted rush
was halted, broken. The desperadoes composing
the attacking force could not stand before that
deadly aim. They broke and ran back toward the
trees, leaving three figures groveling in the sand.</p>
<p>&#8220;One for Mister Frank, and three for me, them
two and one back behind,&#8221; said Tom Barnum grimly,
to Bob and Jack, who were peering over his shoulder.
&#8220;That ain&#8217;t so bad.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>A cry from Captain Folsom, followed by Frank&#8217;s
voice calling urgently, caused the three to spin
around. They were just in time to see one man go
down under a terrific blow from the doughty, one-armed
officer, while Frank leaped in under the arm
of a second desperado, upraised to fire, and brought
him crashing down with a flying tackle.</p>
<p>&#8220;As pretty as I ever saw,&#8221; muttered Bob. &#8220;Old
Frank ought to make the All-American team for
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quick as thought, having felled his man, Captain
Folsom stooped down and wrenched a revolver
from his grasp, then spun about on his knee and
fired just as a third rounded the corner. The man
toppled forward. By this time Bob and Jack had
reached the scene. But the attack from the rear
had spent its force. The three most daring evidently
had taken the lead. And the way they had
been disposed of deterred the others. A half dozen
in number, they hung uncertainly in a group along
the wall of the radio station.</p>
<p>Captain Folsom helped them make up their minds
as to which direction to take by sending several shots
over their heads. Without even waiting to reply,
they ran for cover toward the trees and bushes at
the edge of the clearing.</p>
<p>The man whom Frank had tackled capitulated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
without a struggle, seeing the fight had gone against
him. Frank took his revolver. From the fellow
whom Captain Folsom had shot, and who proved to
be wounded only in the thigh, Bob obtained a revolver.
All except Jack were now armed, and he
had the butcher knife which Frank had carried away
from the Brownell house, although he laughed as
he flourished it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way you fellows treat our friends,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I expect none of them will come close enough to
give me a chance to use this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, approaching
the boys, after having ascertained first that the man
whom he had shot had only a flesh wound; &#8220;we
aren&#8217;t out of the woods yet. These fellows are
determined scoundrels, and they know they can&#8217;t
afford to let us escape. Finding they can&#8217;t rush us,
they will next try to work around through the trees
and attack us from this side. I think we had better
make a dash around Tom Barnum&#8217;s corner and get
into the radio station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how about my going to the beach to meet
Lieutenant Summers?&#8221; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our position ought to be evident to him,&#8221; said
Captain Folsom. &#8220;He can understand what is going
on, and come up cautiously. I can&#8217;t risk having
any of you lads run the gauntlet. I&#8217;ve reproached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
myself a hundred times already for leading you into
danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Captain,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;We volunteered.
And we&#8217;re safe so far, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other shook his head with a smile of admiration.
These boys were made of manly stuff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there is no time to waste. Any
minute we may expect to be peppered from the woods
on this side. Here, you two,&#8221; he added, addressing
the two unwounded prisoners, &#8220;help your pal and
march. We&#8217;re going into the radio station.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men, young, smooth-shaven and looking like
what they were, city toughs, were cowed. Without
a word, they moved to obey.</p>
<p>&#8220;All clear there, Tom?&#8221; asked Captain Folsom of
Tom Barnum, who had kept up his watch at the
forward end of the side wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we move fast we can make it,&#8221; Tom replied.
&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody out here in front but the wounded,
an&#8217; they&#8217;re crawlin&#8217; to cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; answered Captain Folsom. &#8220;Now,
altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick dash from cover, and the party was
safely within the sending room of the station.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s first move was to ascertain whether any
of the enemy had gained entrance to the power
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
house. He approached the connecting door at the
rear of the room. It still was closed and locked.
Tom Barnum had taken up his post inside the door,
which he had swung shut behind him, not, however,
until Frank had found and pressed a wall button
which switched on a cluster of electric lights
overhead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky for us there is no other entrance to the
power house than through this door,&#8221; said Jack.
&#8220;At least there is none, so far as I have seen. If
there had been, they might have slipped in that other
room, come through here and have gotten close
enough to rush us before we could have stopped
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom approached Tom Barnum, after
asking the boys to keep an eye on the prisoners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are keeping watch through a crack in
the door,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But, I believe we would be
better off with the door open entirely. That would
give us a clear view of the side from which attack
must come. We can push this big table across the
doorway, upending it. So.&#8221; And, suiting action
to word, he and Tom dragged the heavy article of
furniture into position. &#8220;Now let us push the door
open,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Just as Tom was about to comply, an outburst of
shooting in the clearing split the air.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hurray,&#8221; shouted Jack. &#8220;The &#8216;Dry Navy&#8217; got
on the job. Come on, fellows, open the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Tom Barnum, who had paused in that very
act, stunned by this new development, completed the
task and the door swung outward, the others crowded
to the barrier of the upended table.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s surmise was apparently correct. Along the
wall of the radio station were ranged a dozen men.
They had been stealing up to pour a hot fire through
the door. But Lieutenant Summers with his landing
party, drawn to the clearing by the sounds of
combat, had made a hurried march up from the
beach, and opened fire. His men were advancing
across the clearing, scattered out fanwise, crouching
and shooting as they came.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, the smugglers were returning
only a ragged fire.</p>
<p>Seeing how matters stood, Captain Folsom
directed the table be pulled away and then, commanding
the boys to keep in the background, he and
Tom Barnum stepped out to the stoop and poured
the contents of their revolvers, fast as they could
pump them, into the smugglers.</p>
<p>The surprise of the latter was complete. Caught
between two fires, they did not know which way to
turn. They wavered a moment, then dashed away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
along the wall of the radio plant in an opposite direction
from the door.</p>
<p>As they disappeared among the trees, pursued by
a detachment of Lieutenant Summer&#8217;s men, the latter
with a half dozen followers dashed up to the
radio plant and, in the lighted doorway, recognized
the figure of his colleague, Captain Folsom.</p>
<p>Greetings were exchanged, and then Captain Folsom
called the boys forward and introduced them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plucky lads, if ever I met any,&#8221; he said, warmly,
&#8220;and resourceful, too. Their ingenuity has pulled
us through time and again to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to mention,&#8221; said Bob, gruffly, &#8220;that it was
my darned foolishness that got us into this scrape
to begin with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, my boy,&#8221; said Captain Folsom. &#8220;You
did only what any of us would have done in jumping
that rascal, Higginbotham. Well, now, let us
head for the house. Probably that is where these
rascals will take refuge. They must be wondering
who you are, Lieutenant, and how you happened
to appear on the scene.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HIGGINBOTHAM ESCAPES</h3>
</div>
<p>A hasty marshalling of forces was first made.
Besides the three boys, Captain Folsom and Tom
Barnum, Lieutenant Summers had twelve men under
his command. Thus they numbered eighteen in
all. It was decided to split this force into two equal
parties, one commanded by Lieutenant Summers,
the other by Captain Folsom.</p>
<p>Tom Barnum went with Lieutenant Summer&#8217;s
party as guide, the boys with Captain Folsom. They
were to move against the front and rear entrances of
the house, summon those within to surrender and,
if necessary, to blockade the house until surrender
was made. As an afterthought, each party detached
a man, as they moved up through the woods, to stand
guard over the tunnel and thus prevent any who had
taken refuge either therein or in the house from
making their escape.</p>
<p>As it proved, however, when Paddy Ryan discovered
he was besieged by government forces, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
surrendered without resistance, together with the
half dozen men with him. The others had scattered
and made their escape. And when the government
forces came to take inventory of their prisoners, it
was discovered that among those who had fled was
Higginbotham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll get nothin&#8217; out of me,&#8221; said Ryan sullenly,
when he was questioned as to Higginbotham&#8217;s
whereabouts. &#8220;He beat it away. That&#8217;s all I
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank&#8217;s quick eye, however, was caught by the
gleam in Ryan&#8217;s glance, and he suspected the other
knew more than he would admit. Drawing his
chums to one side, he said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, fellows, I believe Higginbotham is
hiding in one of two places. Either he is up in the
attic, in that secret passage through which we made
our escape from the dark room, or else hiding in
the tunnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But we
couldn&#8217;t ferret him out alone. If he is hiding in
either place, he is armed, and would have us at his
mercy. A desperate man would shoot. I believe
we would be foolhardy to take such a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ask Captain Folsom&#8217;s advice,&#8221; suggested
Jack, sensibly.</p>
<p>Waiting an opportunity, they beckoned Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Folsom aside and Frank propounded his suspicions.
The latter looked thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Temple,&#8221; he said, emphatically. &#8220;I
am glad you boys told me of this and did not attempt
to make a search by yourselves. Let me see, however,
if we cannot evolve some scheme to bring the
rascal out, provided he is in hiding in one or other
of these places.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facing about, he called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan, come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The leader of the smugglers, who stood lined up
with his men, including the negro, Mike and Pete,
against the wall, under guard, stepped forward.</p>
<p>Quickly Captain Folsom explained his suspicions
as to where Higginbotham might be in hiding.
Then he added:</p>
<p>&#8220;Higginbotham knows your voice. I want you to
go to whichever place he may be hiding and summon
him to come out and surrender. Say that if he refuses,
I shall not imperil the lives of any of my men
by sending them to dig him out, but shall starve him
into submission.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a slight smile of triumph on Paddy
Ryan&#8217;s face as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll go to both places an&#8217; whistle in the
wind. But it&#8217;s in nather place he is, for he did not
return to the house, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; ye.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do as I say, Ryan,&#8221; commanded Captain Folsom,
shortly. &#8220;Try the attic first. The tunnel is
guarded, I may as well tell you, and Higginbotham
cannot make his escape that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. You&#8217;re the captain,&#8221; said Ryan.
&#8220;Follow me.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he turned to proceed up the steps, after ordering
two sailors to accompany Ryan, Captain Folsom
said to the boys and Lieutenant Summers, who had
joined the party:</p>
<p>&#8220;From the way Ryan is acting, I believe he is
trying to throw us off the scent, and that Higginbotham
really is hidden hereabouts.&#8221;</p>
<p>No reply, however, was received in response to
Ryan&#8217;s announcement of the ultimatum laid down
by Captain Folsom, both at the secret passage under
the roof and the other underground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, lips compressed,
at the failure of his stratagem. &#8220;We shall
post guards here until we can decide what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ryan therefore was returned to keep company
with the other prisoners under guard in the big living
room. In another room the two officers, together
with the boys, gathered for a consultation.
Tom Barnum, meantime, seeing that dawn had come,
and that the first faint streaks of daylight were
beginning to light up the woods outside, left the knot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
of sailors to whom he had been recounting the events
of that exciting night and re-entering the house called
Jack aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister Jack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be broad day in
another hour. Don&#8217;t you think I had better go back
and tell the Temples and your housekeeper what&#8217;s
become of you three and of Captain Folsom, too.
If they happen to notice you&#8217;re missin&#8217; they&#8217;ll be
worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, Tom,&#8221; approved Jack. &#8220;But do you think
it&#8217;s safe for you to make the trip alone? Some of
these fellows may be lurking in the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;it&#8217;ll soon be daylight, as I said.
Besides, I&#8217;ll be on the beach. And, anyhow, why
should any of them attack me? They&#8217;ll be runnin&#8217;
like hares to get away, and none of &#8217;em will be
around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thereupon Tom set out, and Jack returned to the
conference. On his re-entry, he learned the two
officers had decided to remove the liquor in the cellar
to the beach and thence by boat to the Nark, as the
easiest method for getting it to New York and the
government warehouses for the storage of confiscated
contraband. A sailor appointed to inspect the
premises had reported finding a large truck and a
narrow but sufficiently wide road through the woods
to the beach. Evidently, it was by this method that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
liquor had been brought from the beach to the house
on occasion.</p>
<p>This would be a long process, but it was considered
better than to attempt to remove the liquor
by truck to New York. Only one truck was available,
in the first place, and that would not carry
more than the smallest portion of the big store of
liquor.</p>
<p>Before the two officers departed to issue the necessary
orders for the carrying out of their plans, Jack
for the first time since he had had that one brief
glimpse of them at the beginning of their adventure,
remembered the torpedo-shaped metal objects on the
beach and spoke about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite sure they must be great containers
controlled by radio,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Probably they were
launched from a liquor ship well out to sea, and
then brought to shore by radio. I suppose Higginbotham
directed the current, although it might have
been that thug with him whom you first attacked,
Bob. That fellow who said it was he had damaged
the airplane. Remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, yes,&#8221; said Bob, starting up, a vengeful
expression on his face. &#8220;And that reminds me.
Where is that particular ruffian, I&#8217;d like to know.
He isn&#8217;t among the prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, he&#8217;s among the wounded,&#8221; suggested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
Jack. &#8220;A half dozen have been gathered up, none
seriously wounded, and are out in the kitchen where
that apprentice surgeon is fixing them up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He referred to one of the sailors, a medical
student who because of ill health had enlisted in the
&#8220;Dry Navy&#8221; in order to obtain an outdoor life.
Lieutenant Summers earlier had assigned him to
look after the injured. Despite all the shooting that
had taken place, none of the sailors had been
wounded, and the boys, Captain Folsom and Tom
represented, with their injuries from blows, the sole
casualties in the government forces. Of the half
dozen smugglers injured, moreover, none had been
shot other than in the arms or legs. As Lieutenant
Summers had explained to the boys, even in pitched
battle a good deal of powder and shot was spent
often without anybody being injured.</p>
<p>Bob made hasty examination of the kitchen and
returned to report the man he sought could not be
located. He found Jack and Frank awaiting him,
the officers having departed to see about preparations
for moving the liquor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe me, if I could find that fellow,&#8221; grunted
Bob, and he did not finish the sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Jack, looking out of the window,
&#8220;it&#8217;s daylight now. Let&#8217;s go down and have a look
at those torpedo things on the beach. Then we can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
take a plunge and go home. I&#8217;m beginning to feel
let down now, and I could sleep the clock around.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others agreed, and passing through the living
room made their way outdoors and headed for
the beach. Frank stopped suddenly, and emitted an
exclamation of disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a fine crowd,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why hasn&#8217;t
one of us thought of that radio-controlled airplane
before? What&#8217;s become of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess it&#8217;s somewhere along shore in Starfish
Cove,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;ll soon see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But arrival at the beach failed to disclose the tiny
speedster of the sky. Only the great metal objects
lay outstretched above the tide, like so many seal
basking in the sun. The disappearance of the plane
was temporarily forgotten, while they investigated.
As they had surmised, these objects proved to be
liquor containers, from several of which the cases
of bottled liquor in the holds had not yet been removed.
They were replicas of each other. At the
rounded end was a propeller driven by an electric
motor. A rudder governed by an electric compass
imparted direction. A wire trailing overside and a
spiral aerial coiled upright about a mast completed
the mechanism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty ingenious,&#8221; declared Jack, inspecting one
of the contrivances. &#8220;And it must have cost a pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
sum to build it, too. These liquor smugglers certainly
must have money behind them. Until we
became involved in this business, I had no idea except
in a general way that all this was going on, certainly
no idea that it was organized as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Jack and Bob bent above the radio boats,
absorbed in examination of them, Frank pursued
further search for the missing radio-controlled airplane.
Presently he rejoined his comrades with the
information that it was to be found nowhere along
the shore and that apparently it had not drifted
away, as at first he had suspected might have been
the case, because the sun had risen now and except
for the Nark and her two boats drawn upon shore,
there was nothing in sight.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he concluded his report, another idea
came to Frank and he laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221; demanded Bob. &#8220;Have you
done&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; Frank interrupted, &#8220;I&#8217;ve not gone crazy,
at least not any more than the rest of you. It just
occurred to me that the reason why we couldn&#8217;t find
Higginbotham links up with the reason why his airplane
is missing. Higginbotham flew away in it,
while that plugugly who damaged our airplane and
whom Bob couldn&#8217;t locate worked the radio for
him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean he had the nerve to come back here
while we were up at the house? And that his man
calmly walked into the radio plant and operated it
for him? Oh, say.&#8221; Bob was contemptuous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Frank coolly. &#8220;What was to
stop him? The airplane makes no noise, and it
would be the easiest matter in the world for Higginbotham
thus to make his escape.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIX_WARNED' id='CHAPTER_XIX_WARNED'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>WARNED!</h3>
</div>
<p>Frank&#8217;s surmise was communicated to Captain
Folsom, and the latter at once sent a radio message
to the Custom House at New York, giving a bare
outline of the details of the raid and asking that a
watch be kept for Higginbotham. Custom House
communicated with the New York Police Department,
and a guard was set at the bridges and ferries
leading from Long Island to Manhattan.</p>
<p>Several days elapsed, however, with Higginbotham
still uncaught. Meanwhile the next day
after that eventful night, the radio-controlled
plane was found floating in the waters of Great
South Bay, so near the shore as to make it practically
impossible Higginbotham had been drowned
but, on the contrary, to give rise to the belief that
he had made his way ashore. A fisherman made
the discovery.</p>
<p>It was some twenty-five miles as the crow flies
from the Brownell place to the point where the airplane
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
came down. That, Jack estimated, when told
of the discovery, probably was the limit of the radio
plant&#8217;s radius of control. Higginbotham, therefore,
had not descended until compelled to do so.</p>
<p>All this, however, did not come until later. Meanwhile,
after saying farewell to the two officers, the
boys returned afoot to their homes with the understanding
on Jack&#8217;s part that Captain Folsom, the
main portion of whose wardrobe still was at his
house, would return later. On arrival, Jack learned
that Tom Barnum already had explained the reason
for his absence to the housekeeper and, after telling
her Captain Folsom should be shown to his room on
arrival, turned in and went instantly to sleep.</p>
<p>As for Bob and Frank, only the servants as yet
were astir at the Temple home. And the boys, after
stating only that they had been routed out by a fire
at the airplane hangar, went instantly to bed.</p>
<p>Once Bob was partially awakened by Della, who
demanded indignantly if he intended to sleep his
young life away and commanded that he awaken
Frank in order that she and her guest might have
company. Bob merely grunted unintelligibly, and
Della retired in a high state of indignation, resolved
to give the boys a &#8220;piece of her mind&#8221; when finally
they should arise.</p>
<p>That event, however, did not come to pass until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
mid-afternoon. Bob on his sister&#8217;s departure the
first time had gotten up and locked the doors of his
room and that of Frank, which adjoined. Thus,
although Della several times came to the door and
knocked, she received no reply.</p>
<p>The &#8220;piece of her mind,&#8221; however, went undelivered
when once the boys did arise, for in the
absorbing story which they had to tell of the night&#8217;s
occurrences, her sense of injury evaporated speedily.
The recital occupied considerable time. At its conclusion,
Bob, who had been looking so frequently
at Della&#8217;s guest, Marjorie Faulkner, as to cause
Frank to chuckle to himself, suggested they play
tennis. But Della protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all we&#8217;ve had to do to-day while you boys
slept,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re tired of tennis. Propose
something else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The airplane&#8217;s out of commission, or I&#8217;d take
you up for a flight,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you like
that, Miss Faulkner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, wouldn&#8217;t I, just,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never
been up in an airplane, and I&#8217;m dying to try it.
What is it like? Does it make you sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob grinned. Before he could reply, Frank
interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Bob,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;we ought to telephone
the factory over in Long Island City right away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and tell them to send a couple of mechanics over here
with new wings and whatever else is needed. First,
though, we ought to make a thorough inventory to
see what we need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob agreed, and, accompanied by the girls, they
repaired to the hangar. After returning to the
house, Frank rang up the airplane factory, and gave
the necessary orders. He was told the mechanics
would arrive the next day with all that was required,
but that putting the plane into condition would take
three or four days at the least.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just when I had it all in good shape for flying,&#8221;
mourned Bob, on his chum&#8217;s return. &#8220;Oh, what
I&#8217;d do to that little monkey, Higginbotham, if I had
the chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grinned as he uttered the threat, yet it could
be seen that he was badly cut up by the damaging of
the plane. Frank said nothing, but threw an arm
over his shoulder as they walked back to the house,
and for the remainder of the journey neither had
much to say, leaving it to the girls to carry the
burden of conversation.</p>
<p>Arrived at the house, they found Jack with Captain
Folsom. The latter was introduced to the girls,
whom he had not met on his arrival the night
previous.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to say good-bye,&#8221; he explained to Bob
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
and Frank. &#8220;I have to go back to the city, and
Hampton is going to motor me to the railway. I
can&#8217;t thank you fellows enough for your part in this
affair. If it hadn&#8217;t been for your perspicacity, in
the first place, we might not have gotten wind of
what was going on. And the way you all fought
and acted on your own initiative time and again when
we were in trouble was fine, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to come down again, Captain,&#8221; said
big Bob, on whom the other had made a favorable
impression.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be delighted to do so, sometime,&#8221; Captain
Folsom replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Captain,&#8221; interposed Frank, &#8220;keep
us posted, will you, on how this affair turns out?
Let us know if Higginbotham is located.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; the other promised. &#8220;Well,
good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>And bowing to the girls, he crossed the lawn to
Jack&#8217;s side and the two swung down the drive to
where Jack had left the car parked by the side of the
main road at the gate.</p>
<p>On Jack&#8217;s return, he informed his chums that the
liquor at the Brownell place had been removed to the
Nark, the captives placed aboard, and that then Lieutenant
Summers had steamed away, leaving a detail
of men on guard at the house and the radio plant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
to round up any of the smugglers who, thinking the
place deserted, might straggle back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave me a bit of advice to be passed on to
you fellows,&#8221; Jack added, out of hearing of the girls.
&#8220;That was, to go about armed for a time, and to be
on guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Bob, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Jack replied, &#8220;he said some of those fellows
who escaped into the woods undoubtedly would
have it in for us for having spoiled their plans, and
that it was barely possible they might have learned
where we live and might try to waylay us. He
pointed out the men were a desperate lot, and that
some of them were Italians who are notoriously
revengeful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; grunted Bob, contemptuously.</p>
<p>Frank, however, showed anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Bob,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;But
Captain Folsom wouldn&#8217;t have given Jack that warning
if there were no grounds for it. Look here,
Jack,&#8221; he added, &#8220;Uncle George won&#8217;t be home to-night.
Have you heard from your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The housekeeper received a message while I slept
that he wouldn&#8217;t be out for several days,&#8221; Jack
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;I believe it would be a good
plan for you to sleep at our house. At any rate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
until your father returns home. You can bunk in
with me. I&#8217;ve got a big bed. Then, if anything
happens at night, we&#8217;ll all be together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; Jack agreed. &#8220;Not that
I expect anything will occur. But, as you say, if
there is trouble, it is best to be together. Well, now
let&#8217;s join the girls. We&#8217;ve still got some daylight
left, and we might make up doubles for tennis.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>OUT FOR REVENGE</h3>
</div>
<p>After dinner, which the five young people ate
without the presence of their elders, as even Mrs.
Temple was absent, having been picked up in a
friend&#8217;s motor car during the afternoon and whisked
away to a country home near Southampton, all adjourned
to the gallery. A desultory conversation
was maintained, but presently at a whisper from
Frank, Della slipped indoors with him. Then from
the long french windows of the music room came
two voices mingling harmoniously in the strains of an
old Southern melody to an accompaniment played by
Della on the piano.</p>
<p>The others listened until the conclusion which they
greeted with spirited applause. Then by common
consent all three arose and went in to join. Thereafter
for an hour, the singing continued, with first
Della and then Miss Faulkner at the piano.</p>
<p>When the common repertoire of songs had been
nigh exhausted, Bob who had wandered off to a
window and stood there in the breeze, looking out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
at the play of moonlight on the lawn, returned with
a suggestion that they all go for a short spin in the
motor boat. The others eagerly assented. What a
lark. A spin in a speed boat under the moonlight.</p>
<p>Wraps and sweaters were procured, for although
the night was warm it would be cool on the water,
especially if any speed were attained. Then the party
set out, Jack and Bob squiring Miss Faulkner, and
Frank slightly in the rear with Della.</p>
<p>On the walk to the boathouse Della reproached
Frank for having taken so many risks the previous
night. He regarded her slyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Jack and Bob took risks, too,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Della flushed. Was the young rascal intimating
her interest in him was greater than in the others.
She was about to reply tartly, but Frank awkwardly
took her hand and squeezed it, then hurriedly released
it again. Demonstrations of affection were not frequent
between these two, yet they had a pretty good
understanding. They walked on in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the same, Frank,&#8221; said Della presently, &#8220;you
must take better care of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank nodded. He did not trust himself to speak.
The interest shown by this girl with whom he had
grown up, living in the same household with her
from early boyhood, threw him into a softened mood.
Then, too, the moonlit surroundings were not without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
their effect. He knew that if he spoke now, he
would say something &#8220;soft.&#8221; So he maintained his
silence.</p>
<p>The trio ahead meanwhile chattered gaily. And at
length the boathouse was reached. Bob swung back
the door and, all pushing together, the boat was
trundled out on its little trucks, removed to the chute
in which rollers were set, and rolled down to the
water and launched. Then all climbed in, Bob examined
the fuel supply and found the boat well
stocked, Jack seized the tiller, they seated themselves
in the little cockpit and, with Bob manipulating the
engine, the boat moved away, gathered speed and,
with a roar, began zipping out to sea.</p>
<p>It was glorious sport, to which four of the five
were accustomed, but which they enjoyed enormously
no matter how often engaged in. To Miss Faulkner
it was a revelation, and bundled in a sweater, her
hair loosed and flying back in the wind, her eyes
dancing with the zest of the adventure, she looked
like an elf, as Della told Frank in a whispered aside.
Frank nodded and grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob thinks so, too,&#8221; he whispered in reply. &#8220;He
can&#8217;t keep his eyes off her. If we didn&#8217;t have the
whole sea ahead of us, he&#8217;d run into something sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up and up and up went the speedometer. The
boat seemed no longer to be rushing through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
water. It spurned that heavier element, and took to
the air. It leaped from crest to crest of the swells.
The girls shrieked, the boys let out great chesty
whoops of pure animal delight. Then Bob cut down
the speed and Jack, controlling the tiller, swung her
about towards home. They had been out only half
an hour, but the shore was miles away. However,
the return was made without incident or trouble of
any kind, the motor working perfectly, and once
more they stepped ashore at the boat landing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which do you like best, Mr. Temple,&#8221; asked
Marjorie Faulkner, as big Bob rejoined the party
on the landing, after locking the doors; &#8220;boating,
flying or motoring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Bob, &#8220;there&#8217;s something
fascinating about every one of the three. To
feel that powerful engine under your control, that&#8217;s
what grips me. It&#8217;s power, you know; you have
vast power under your control. They&#8217;re all good,&#8221;
he concluded, with a quick look at the others who
were moving away, &#8220;but to-night I like boating
best.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her so pointedly that her eyes
dropped. Then she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And think of you saying that,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;Why, Della always told me you were a perfect bear
and never made a pretty speech to a girl in your life.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Neither did I,&#8221; said Bob, boldly, &#8220;before to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the girl laughed as she danced away
after the others, but Bob following her was sure
he had not displeased.</p>
<p>Events of the previous night were far from the
thoughts of any of the boys, as they moved across
the open sandhills along the beach and approached
the grove separating them from the Temple home.
There was no thought of danger in their minds.</p>
<p>But barely had they entered the narrow trail, walking
single file, Jack in the lead, followed by Frank,
Della and Miss Faulkner, with Bob bringing up the
rear, than from the trees on either side darted a
number of men who sprang upon them. The girls
screamed in fright and alarm, their shrieks rending
the silence of the night.</p>
<p>Cursing, several of the attackers sprang for them,
too, they were seized, and rough hands clapped over
their mouths.</p>
<p>But, attacked thus unexpectedly though they were,
and without weapons, the boys fought desperately.
How many their assailants numbered they could not
tell. There was no time to take account. Frank was
bowled over by the sudden rush, Jack borne back
against a tree, Bob managed to keep his footing, his
arms wrapped about the body of his own assailant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>Every muscle and nerve taut, Frank sprang up as
if actuated by a spring, tripped the man who had
attacked him and leaped towards the fellow who had
Della in his arms. In falling, his hand had come in
contact with a stone the size of his fist and he had
clutched it. Della&#8217;s assailant had seized her from the
rear and was bending her backward, a hand across
her mouth. His back was towards Frank. The
latter brought down the stone on the man&#8217;s head with
a tremendous crash, and the fellow&#8217;s arms relaxed,
setting Della free, then he fell to the ground, stunned.</p>
<p>The man whom he had tripped made a leap for
Frank, but his blood up, the boy dodged aside to
avoid the blind rush and, as the man lurched past,
he lashed out with his right fist. The blow caught
the other under the ear, a fatal spot, and sent him
toppling to the ground.</p>
<p>Meantime, Jack, with his back to a big tree, was
hard pressed by two men. In the hand of one
gleamed a dagger. Good boxer though he was, Jack
could not ward off an attack like that for long, and
Frank realized it. He sprang forward to go to the
rescue. Then a blow on the head felled him, and all
became darkness.</p>
<p>That blow came from a blackjack in the hands of
Marjorie Faulkner&#8217;s assailant. Seeing the danger
to his comrades from Frank, he released the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
and attacked Frank. But his act brought down on
him a perfect fury, tearing, scratching at his face.
It was Della, crying with rage at the danger to
Frank, insensible to everything else. She was a
whirlwind and the man had all he could do to ward
her off. In fact, he did not fully succeed, for her
hands found his face and her tearing fingers ripped
a long gash down over his right eye, from which the
blood began to spout. Temporarily blinded, he
dropped his blackjack, and stumbled back, cursing.</p>
<p>Della did not follow up her advantage, but dropped
to her knees beside Frank and pillowed his head in
her lap. His eyes were closed. The blow that had
felled him had been a shrewd one. Fortunately, however,
instead of descending full on his head, it had
glanced off one side. As she cradled him, smoothing
back his hair and crying unrestrainedly, Frank
opened his eyes and gazed up.</p>
<p>For a moment his daze continued. Or did it?
Was there not a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes,
quickly veiled, as he saw who had come to his rescue?</p>
<p>Then he started to struggle to his feet.</p>
<p>All this had taken very little time and, while it
progressed, Bob had been gripped body to body with
the biggest of the attacking party, a husky fellow of
his own six foot height but with the added weight
of a greater length of years. As this man leaped for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
him from the woods, arm upraised with a blackjack
clutched in his hand, Bob had seized the descending
wrist and thrown his other arm about the fellow&#8217;s
body. Thus they had wrestled.</p>
<p>As Frank shakily, with Della&#8217;s assistance, was
getting to his feet, there came a panting cry from
Bob, another scream from Miss Faulkner. Then
through the air went flying the form of Bob&#8217;s assailant.
He had fallen victim to Bob&#8217;s famous wrestling
grip, which lifted the man from his feet and sent him
flying over Bob&#8217;s head. But into the propulsion this
time Bob put all his great strength. The result was
that, instead of falling immediately behind Bob, the
fellow cannoned through the air a distance of several
yards.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, this human meteor descended
upon one of Jack&#8217;s assailants, and the pair
went down to the ground together. At this, the
other man turned and fled incontinently into the
woods.</p>
<p>The first round had been won. But there were
still five assailants left. And all armed, while the
boys were without weapons. Frank saw the danger
of delay and called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, Jack, quick. We must get the girls home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaking his head to clear it, he seized Della by the
hand and started running towards the house. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
glance sufficed to show him the others saw the
danger of delay, and were pelting after him with
Marjorie Faulkner. Bob was bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>But their troubles were not ended. Thus far the
attackers had refrained from using revolvers in order
to avoid bringing others to the scene. But, seeing
their prey escape, several now whipped out weapons
and began to fire.</p>
<p>Bob, the last in line, groaned:</p>
<p>&#8220;Got me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fell. Jack spun around, took in the situation,
then called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls, you run on home and get help. Frank and
I will stay with Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hurt much,&#8221; Bob declared. &#8220;Just put my
leg out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He struggled to regain his feet.</p>
<p>Several more shots whistled unpleasantly close.
Their assailants were approaching, shooting as they
came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, girls,&#8221; cried Jack.</p>
<p>They darted away.</p>
<p>Suddenly Tom Barnum came crashing through the
woods, service revolver gripped in his hand. He
had been aroused, as he slept nearby at the Hampton
radio plant, by the cries of the girls on first being
attacked. In the moonlight, it was not difficult to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
see at which party to fire, and Tom did not hesitate.
He sent a half dozen bullets whistling about the
attacking party in quick succession. The arrival of
reinforcements completed the discomfiture of the
latter. They fled back towards the beach.</p>
<p>Tom was all for pursuing them, but Jack called to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Tom, let &#8217;em go. Bob&#8217;s hurt. Help us
get him to the house.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE MOTOR BOAT STOLEN</h3>
</div>
<p>When the boys and Tom Barnum arrived at the
Temples&#8217;, they found the household in a great state
of excitement. Some of the maids were hysterical.
But Frank and Della, with a few sharp-spoken words,
shamed the women and brought them to their senses.
However, it was not to be wondered at that hysteria
prevailed, as there were few men about to give protection
in case of an attack on the house, the butler
being an oldish and timorous man and the chauffeur
absent.</p>
<p>Frank assured the women, however, that they need
not fear attack, and they retired to the servant&#8217;s
quarters.</p>
<p>Meantime, Jack and Tom Barnum had assisted
Bob to his rooms and examined his injury. It was
found he had been struck by bullets not only once
but twice. In neither case, however, was the injury
serious. One had creased his right thigh, the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
pierced the calf without touching the bone. The
wounds were bandaged and dressed.</p>
<p>Then a consultation was held, which both Della
and Marjorie Faulkner insisted on attending. Both
had been thoroughly frightened, but were plucky
spirits, and the boys were loud in praise of their
behavior. Frank could not thank Della enough for
her interference to save him from the ruffian who had
felled him.</p>
<p>It was decided that, due to their isolation and the
nature of the country, it would be highly unwise as
well as unprofitable to attempt to go in search of the
ruffians. Tom Barnum, however, was instructed to
send a warning by radio to the government men at
the Brownell radio plant that these fellows were in
the neighborhood, and this commission he duly carried
out on his return to his quarters.</p>
<p>The boys were of the opinion that they had seen
the last of the smugglers, and that, thwarted in their
attempt to gain revenge, the latter would now make
their way to the railroad and return to Brooklyn and
Manhattan. For that the attack upon them was
caused by a desire to obtain revenge, they had no
doubt. It was what Captain Folsom had told them
they might expect.</p>
<p>What was their dismay, however, the next day
when, on arriving at the boathouse they discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
the door broken open, and the new speed boat, pride
of the trio, gone. Bob who had hobbled along by the
aid of a cane groaned as he stared at the vacant space
where the boat had been stowed on their return the
night before.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re out of luck,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Airplane damaged, motor boat stolen,&#8221; said
Frank. &#8220;What next?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jack refused to lament. His eyes blazed with
wrath.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is too much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to do
something about this. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a consultation, it was decided to call Captain
Folsom by radio at the Custom House and apprise
him of the latest turn in the situation. By great
good luck, Captain Folsom was in the Custom House
at the time, on business connected with the disposal
of the vast amount of liquor taken from the Brownell
house. He commiserated with the boys on their hard
luck, as well as on their lucky escape the previous
night when unexpectedly attacked.</p>
<p>He promised to notify the New York police who
would keep a lookout for the motor boat along both
the Brooklyn and Manhattan water fronts. Furthermore,
he agreed to undertake to notify the police
authorities of towns along the Long Island shore between
the Temple estate and the metropolis, so that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
in case the smugglers made a landing and abandoned
the boat, the boys would be notified where to recover
it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, he added that the big raid and the
arrest of Paddy Ryan and others at the Brownell
house had not as yet brought to light the principals
in the liquor-smuggling ring. The lesser prisoners,
questioned separately, maintained that Ryan and
Higginbotham were the sole principals known to
them. Higginbotham had not been found, and Ryan
refused to talk. It was Captain Folsom&#8217;s opinion,
however, that one or more men of wealth and,
possibly, of social or financial position, were behind
the plot.</p>
<p>&#8220;You boys have been of such assistance,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;that I&#8217;m telling you this, first, because I know you
will be interested, but, secondly, because I want to
put you on the lookout. You have shown yourselves
such sensible, clever fellows that, if you keep your
ears open, who knows but what you will stumble on
something of importance. I believe the man or men
behind the plot may live in the &#8216;Millionaire Colony&#8217;
down your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Captain Folsom had told the boys opened a
new line for thought, and they discussed the matter
at some length after finishing the radio conversation.
The girls also were keenly interested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so romantic,&#8221; said Della. &#8220;Just like the olden
days when smuggling was a recognized industry in
England, for instance, and big merchants holding
positions of respectability and honor connived with
the runners of contraband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t go that far from home,&#8221; said Frank,
a student of Long Island colonial history. &#8220;There
was a time when, on both coasts of Long Island,
pirates and smugglers made their headquarters and
came and went unmolested. In fact, the officials
of that day were in league with the rascals, and there
was at least one governor of the Province of New
York who feathered his nest nicely by having an
interest in both kinds of ventures.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys knew the names of most of the owners of
great estates along the Long Island shore up to
Southampton and beyond, and some time was spent
in laughing speculation as to whether this or that
great man was involved in the liquor-smuggling plot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Folsom said,&#8221; explained Jack, &#8220;that so
much money necessarily was involved in the purchase
and movement of all that liquor, in the radio equipment,
the buying of the Brownell place, the hiring
of ships, the employment of many men, and so on,
that he was pretty certain the men captured were only
underlings and not principals. And, certainly, the
business must have taken a great deal of money.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>Several days passed without the boys hearing further
from Captain Folsom, nor was any word received
that their motor boat had been recovered.
They came to be of the opinion that it had been either
scuttled or abandoned in some lonely spot upon which
nobody had stumbled, or else that the thieves had
managed to elude police vigilance in the harbor of
New York. That the thieves might have used it to
make their way to sea to a rendezvous where the ships
of the liquor-smugglers&#8217; fleet gathered did not occur
to them, for the reason that despite the knowledge
they had gained of the contraband traffic they were
not aware as yet of its extent. Yet such was what
actually had happened, as events were to prove.</p>
<p>Meantime, both Mr. Temple and Mr. Hampton
returned to their homes, to be amazed at the tale of
developments during their absence. Over their cigars
in Mr. Hampton&#8217;s library, the two, alone, looked at
each other and smiling shook their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to scold Jack for running his head into
trouble,&#8221; said Mr. Hampton. &#8220;But&mdash;well, it&#8217;s great
to be young, George, and to have adventure come
and hunt you out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Temple nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave Bob and Frank a talking-to,&#8221; he commented.
&#8220;Told them they had no business getting
into trouble the minute my back was turned. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
Bob said: &#8216;Well, Dad, we got into trouble when
your back wasn&#8217;t turned, too, out there in California
last year. And we got you out of it, as a matter of
fact.&#8217; And Frank said: &#8216;We manage to come out
on top, Uncle George.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Hampton laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack said something of the sort to me, too,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;He recalled that it was only by putting his
head into trouble, as I called it, that he managed to
rescue me when I was a prisoner in Mexico and to
prevent international complications.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great to be young,&#8221; said Mr. Temple, looking
at the glowing tip of his cigar.</p>
<p>Both men smoked in silence.</p>
<p>Sunday came and went without further developments.
But on the next day, Monday, the fifth day
after the momentous night at the Brownell place,
Captain Folsom called the boys by radio. Tom
Barnum, on duty at the plant, summoned Jack. The
latter presently appeared at the Temple home in a
state of high excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellows,&#8221; he cried, spying his chums
sprawled out on the gallery, reading; &#8220;what would
you say to a sea voyage, with a chance for a little
excitement?&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank dropped his book and rolled out of the
hammock in which he was swaying lazily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded, scrambling to
his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bob, who was comfortably sprawled
out in a long low wicker chair; &#8220;what&#8217;s it all about?&#8221;</p>
<p>He heaved a cushion at Jack, which the latter
caught and returned so quickly that it caught Bob
amidships and brought him to feet with a bound. He
winced a little. His injured leg, although well on the
road to recovery, was not yet in a condition to withstand
sudden jolting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch,&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Sic &#8217;em, Frank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let up,&#8221; declared Jack, warding off the combined
attacks of his two chums, who began belaboring him
with cushions; &#8220;let up, or I&#8217;ll keep this to myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pair fell back, but with cushions still held
aloft menacingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t good,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;look out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is good, all right,&#8221; said Jack, and hurriedly
he explained. Captain Folsom was about to
set out from New York with Lieutenant Summers
aboard the Nark to investigate reports that a veritable
fleet of liquor-smuggling vessels was some miles out
to sea off Montauk Point, the very tip of Long
Island. On their way, they would stop off at the
Brownell place and send a boat ashore with a change
of guards to relieve those on duty. They would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
at the rendezvous in the course of the next three
hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Folsom said,&#8221; concluded Jack, &#8220;that it
had occurred to him the smugglers who stole our
motor boat might have made out to this fleet, and
invited us to go along to identify the boat in case
it was found. He said there was just a bare chance
of its being located, and he didn&#8217;t want to arouse our
hopes unduly. Also, he added that there would be
no danger, and he thought we would enjoy the
outing. This time, however, he said, he would not
take us unless by the permission of our parents. If
that could be obtained, we should make our way to
the Brownell place and the boat would pick us up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurray,&#8221; cried Frank, executing a war dance.
&#8220;Whoo-oo-oo-oo-oo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call up your father, Bob,&#8221; said Jack, &#8220;and ask
him. I&#8217;ll run home and get my Dad on the long
distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both boys hastened to execute the commission, and
when Jack returned in an incredibly short time it was
with his father&#8217;s permission to make the trip. Mr.
Temple proved similarly amiable. Both men felt
there could be no danger to the boys on such an
expedition, as it was altogether unlikely that any
liquor-runners would make a stand against an armed
vessel of the United States Navy. Also, they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
struck by Captain Folsom&#8217;s reasoning as to the possible
whereabouts of the motor boat and, knowing
how the boys were put out at the loss, they felt it
was only fair to the chums to permit them to run
down this clue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good three miles to Starfish Cove,&#8221; said
Jack, anxiously. &#8220;Can you make it all right on that
bum leg, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer Bob swung the wounded member back
and forth several times. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold out all right,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;If I can&#8217;t make it all the way, you fellows
can carry me. I&#8217;m only a slight load.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank groaned in mock dismay.</p>
<p>The girls had gone visiting with Mrs. Temple. So,
leaving a note to explain their absence, the boys
set out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>WORD OF A STRANGE CRAFT</h3>
</div>
<p>Picked up by the boat at Starfish Cove, to which
Bob had made his way without suffering any great
inconvenience, the boys were rowed to the Nark
where they were greeted on deck by Captain Folsom
and Lieutenant Summers.</p>
<p>At once the speedy craft got under way again, and
was soon edging seaward yet with the low coast line
on her bow, a creaming smother of water under her
forefoot. Lieutenant Summers, after greeting the
boys pleasantly, returned to his duties. Leaning over
the rail with them, Captain Folsom began to speak
of the liquor smugglers.</p>
<p>No trace had been found of Higginbotham, he
said. Inquiry had been made at the McKay Realty
Company offices, but Mr. McKay who was said to
be out of the city on business, had not yet returned,
and nobody else could be found who could give any
information of Higginbotham&#8217;s haunts. It was
learned he led a bachelor existence and had rooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
at a downtown apartment hotel. The hotel had been
visited, but Higginbotham had not put in an appearance
nor called by telephone.</p>
<p>A search warrant had been obtained and the rooms
entered and inspected. But no papers of any sort
that would give a clue to Higginbotham&#8217;s connections
in the liquor traffic were found. A canny man, he
had avoided keeping any such incriminating documents
about. Ryan and the other prisoners had been
released on bail, Ryan himself putting up the bond
money which amounted to a large sum.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only I could lay my hands on the principals
behind this plot,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, thoughtfully.
&#8220;The liquor smuggling is growing, and there is every
evidence that some organizing genius with a great
deal of money at his command is behind it. The
newest manifestation of the smugglers&#8217; activities
came the other day when an airplane which fell into
a field near Croton-on-Hudson and was abandoned
by the aviator, who was unhurt, was found to have
carried 200 bottles of expensive Canadian liquor.
And a map of the route from an island in the St.
Lawrence near Montreal to Glen Falls, New York,
thence to New York City was found in the cockpit.
It was well-thumbed, and showed the trip must have
been made many times of late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, if you do catch the principal, won&#8217;t that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
merely result in curtailing activities of the smugglers
for the time being, but not in putting a permanent
stop to them?&#8221; asked Frank. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t the
profits so large that somebody else with money, some
other organizing genius as you say, will take up the
work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, you are right,&#8221; said Captain Folsom.
&#8220;This prohibition law has brought to pass a mighty
queer state of affairs in our country. It is one law
that many people feel no compunctions at violating.
Nevertheless, I feel that behind all these liquor violations
in and around New York City to-day there is
a man of prominence, someone who has united most
of the small operators under his control, and who
virtually has organized a Liquor Smugglers&#8217; Trust.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can land that man,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we will
strike a blow that will deter others for a long time
to come from trying to follow his example. And I
have the feeling that the events which you boys precipitated
will lead us to that man&mdash;the Man Higher
Up.&#8221;</p>
<p>So interested were the boys in this conversation
that they failed to note the near approach of the
Nark to an ancient schooner. They stood gazing at
the creaming water under the bow, caps pulled low
over their eyes to protect them from the sun&#8217;s glare,
and their radius of vision was strictly limited. Now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
however, the speed of the Nark sensibly diminished
until, when they looked up in surprise and gazed
around to see what was occurring, the boys found
the Nark practically at a standstill while a cable&#8217;s
length away rode an ancient schooner, lumbering
along under all sail, to take advantage of the light
airs.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the ring-tailed caterpillar,&#8221; exclaimed Frank,
employing a quaint expression current the last term
at Harrington Hall, &#8220;where did that caravel of Columbus
come from? Why, she&#8217;s so old you might
expect the Ancient Mariner to peer over her rail.
Yes, and there he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed at the figure of a whiskered skipper,
wearing a dingy derby, who peered over the rail at
this moment in response to a hail from the Nark.</p>
<p>There was some foundation, in truth, for Frank&#8217;s
suggestion. The old schooner whose name they now
discerned in faded gilt as &#8220;Molly M,&#8221; seemed like
a ghost of other days. Her outthrust bow, her up-cocked
stern and the figurehead of a simpering
woman that might have been mermaid originally but
was now so worn as to make it almost impossible to
tell the original intent, was, indeed, suggestive of
galleons of ancient days. This figurehead jutted out
beneath the bowsprit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh. Heh.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>As the skipper of the ancient craft thus responded
to the hail from the Nark, he put a hand to his ear
as if hard of hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lay to. U. S. patrol boat,&#8221; returned Lieutenant
Summers, impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently our friend believes we have come up
with a liquor smuggler,&#8221; said Captain Folsom, in an
aside, to the boys.</p>
<p>But the old skipper, whose craft was drawing away
while the Nark rocked idly in the swell, with her
engines barely turning over, merely repeated his gesture
of putting a hand to his ear, and once more
called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh. Heh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the deck beneath the feet of the boys
quivered slightly, there was the report of a three-pounder,
and a shot fell across the bow of the old
schooner, kicking up a feather of spray. The Ancient
Mariner, as Frank had dubbed him, came to life.
He danced up and down on his deck, where two or
three other figures of seamen now appeared. He
shook his fist at the Nark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m outside the three-mile limit,&#8221; he screamed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the law on ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He means,&#8221; explained Captain Folsom to the
boys, &#8220;that he is beyond the jurisdiction of United
States waters and on the open sea.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the old skipper barked out an order,
sailors sprang to obey, sails came down, and the
schooner lay hove to. Then the Nark approached
until only a boat&#8217;s length away. On the deck of the
schooner, only the skipper stood. The seamen had
gone below, their tasks completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, my man,&#8221; said Lieutenant Summers,
&#8220;you may be outside the three-mile limit, but you are
drawing the line pretty fine. What are your papers?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old skipper looked at him shrewdly, quizzically,
from out his ambush of whiskers. A slow grin
broke over his features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye know well as I we&#8217;m outside the three-mile
limit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I don&#8217;t mind tellin&#8217; ye. I got
liquor aboard. But my papers is all clear, an&#8217; ye can&#8217;t
touch me. I&#8217;m from Nassau in the Bahamas for St.
John. Two British possessions. An&#8217; I&#8217;m on my
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Summers&#8217;s face grew red. Captain
Folsom&#8217;s eyes twinkled, and the boys saw one of the
Nark&#8217;s crew, an old salt, put up a big palm to hide
a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old shellback has our skipper,&#8221; whispered
Captain Folsom to the boys. &#8220;He has him on the hip.
We are outside the three-mile limit, undoubtedly.
To think of the old Yankee&#8217;s spunk in telling us he
has liquor aboard. His papers will be as he says,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
too, but just the same that liquor will never reach
St. John. It is destined for a landing on our own
coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Summers also was of the opinion
apparently that he had been foiled. And little as he
relished the fact that the old skipper was laughing
at him up his sleeve, there was naught he could do
about it. However, he decided to pay a visit to the
&#8220;Molly M,&#8221; for he called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand by to receive a boat. I am coming aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, the boys saw the little boat dancing over
the waves, then Lieutenant Summers climbed to the
deck of the schooner, and he and the old skipper
disappeared together down the companionway.</p>
<p>Awaiting his return, Captain Folsom enlightened
the boys about the difficulties of preventing liquor
from being smuggled into the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you can see from this instance,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the
traffic is carried on openly, or under only a thin coating
of camouflage. That boat fully intends, no
doubt, to land its cargo along our coast somewhere.
But her papers are all in order and as long as she
stays outside the three-mile limit we can do nothing
about it. Of course, we can hang to her heels and
prevent her from landing. But while we are doing
that, other smugglers slip ashore somewhere else.
It&#8217;s a weary business to try and enforce such a law
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
at first. And, what makes it harder,&#8221; he concluded,
his brow clouding, &#8220;is that every now and then some
member of the enforcement service sells out to the
liquor ring, and then the rest of us who are doing our
work honestly and as best we can are given a black
eye, for everybody says: &#8216;Ah, yes, they&#8217;re all crooks.
I thought so.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But here,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is Lieutenant Summers returning.
Now we shall see what he found out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old skipper and the naval officer appeared on
the schooner&#8217;s deck, Lieutenant Summers went overside,
and the boat returned with him. Once more
the schooner put on sail, and began to draw away.
When he reached the deck, Lieutenant Summers sent
a sailor to summon Captain Folsom and the boys
below. They joined him in the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have news for you boys,&#8221; said Lieutenant Summers,
at once. &#8220;Captain Woolley of the &#8216;Molly M&#8217;
proved to be a pretty smooth article,&#8221; and he smiled
wryly, &#8220;but from a member of his crew, one of my
men learned that a speed boat answering the description
of your stolen craft had been seen alongside
a sub chaser manned by a crew in naval uniform off
Atlantic Highlands on the Jersey coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurray,&#8221; cried Frank, &#8220;one of your fleet must
have recaptured it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Summers shook his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the puzzling thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If one of
our boats had found your craft adrift or captured
it with the fugitive smugglers aboard, I would have
been notified by radio. You see, the schooner sighted
the sub chaser and motor boat yesterday. This sailor,
a talkative chap apparently, told my man they thought
the chaser was a ship of the &#8216;Dry Navy&#8217; and crowded
on all canvas to edge away from dangerous company.
Then, he said, they could see these uniformed men
aboard the chaser leaning on the rail and holding
their sides from laughing at the schooner. What
it all meant, he didn&#8217;t know, but at any rate the chaser
made no attempt to pursue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you haven&#8217;t heard from any of your fleet
that our boat was recovered?&#8221; asked Jack, in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;From none,&#8221; said Lieutenant Summers. &#8220;However,
I shall order &#8216;Sparks&#8217; at once to query all the
ships.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>IN STARFISH COVE AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Sparks&#8221; as the radio operator aboard the sub
chaser was known, sat down to his key at once and
sent out a wireless call for all members of the &#8220;Dry
Navy,&#8221; requesting information as to whether any
had recovered the stolen speed boat belonging to the
boys.</p>
<p>One by one, from their various stations along the
coast, the boats responded, giving negative replies.
Several hours elapsed before all had been heard from.
Meantime the Nark crisscrossed and quartered the
sea off Montauk Point, in search of the rumored
&#8220;fleet&#8221; of liquor runners, but without success. Numerous
sail were sighted as well as steamers, but the
latter were all so large as to preclude in the opinion
of the revenue men the possibility of their being
liquor carriers, and the former never stood close
enough to be examined. Nor did any assemblage of
vessels sufficiently large to warrant the designation
&#8220;fleet&#8221; appear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Late in the day, when the low descending sun
warned of the approach of nightfall, and the boys&#8217;
watches showed 7 o&#8217;clock, Lieutenant Summers again
consulted with Captain Folsom, who presently rejoined
the boys with word that they were going to
turn back and cruise offshore and that the boys in an
hour or two could be landed, not at Starfish Cove,
but at their own boathouse, thus involving only a
short trip afoot home for Bob.</p>
<p>Hardly had the boat&#8217;s course been altered, however,
when &#8220;Sparks&#8221; appeared from the radio room
in a state of high excitement, addressed Lieutenant
Summers who was on the little bridge, and the two
returned together. The wireless room originally had
been the chart house. It was equipped for the employment,
both sending and receiving, of wireless
telegraphy and telephony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what is up,&#8221; said Captain Folsom to the
boys, with whom he was talking in the bow. &#8220;Something
has come by radio that has excited &#8216;Sparks.&#8217;
Excuse me, boys, a moment, while I go to inquire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom, however, had not had time to
reach the radio room when Lieutenant Summers
again appeared on the bridge, and beckoned both him
and the boys to approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain in a moment,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as soon as I
can give the necessary orders.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>A number of orders were delivered, and the men on
deck leaped to execute them with alacrity. What
their purport, was not made known, of course, but the
helmsman was given a course direct for Starfish Cove
and, in response to signals to the engine room for
full speed ahead, the craft seemed fairly to leap
through the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has happened ashore,&#8221; said Frank, to
his companions. &#8220;I wonder what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their curiosity was soon to be satisfied. Lieutenant
Summers led the way below to his cabin, and,
once all five were gathered inside, he lost no time in
coming to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mystery of that sub chaser seen by the crew
of the &#8216;Molly M&#8217; with your speed boat in tow is in a
fair way to be solved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Also, I have high
hopes of catching the ringleader of the liquor smugglers
whom Captain Folsom and I have been
seeking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? What&#8217;s that?&#8221; demanded Captain Folsom,
excitedly.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Summers nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t imagine in a thousand years where
the radio call came from,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;nor what it
was all about. Well, I&#8217;ll not attempt to mystify you
any further. The call was from one of the guards
I left posted at the Brownell place, and he was calling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
not from the Brownell radio station, but from
yours, Hampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From our station?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack was puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with his own?&#8221; asked Frank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our guards have been captured by raiders dressed
in naval uniform who disembarked from a sub
chaser,&#8221; said Lieutenant Summers, exploding his
bombshell. &#8220;Only one man escaped. And he made
his way to your station, Hampton, found your man,
Tom Barnum, there and began calling for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of the three boys shone, as the implication
reached them. The smugglers evidently had
obtained possession of a sub chaser and wearing
U. S. naval uniforms had carried out a bold coup
d&#8217;etat, although for what purpose could not be seen
at the time. It looked as if there were a fair prospect
of action, and all were excited in consequence.</p>
<p>Captain Folsom, however, began hunting at once
for causes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why in the world should such a move have
been carried out?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Of course, I take
it the smugglers have obtained a sub chaser somewhere,
together with uniforms. Yet why should they
seek to recapture the Brownell place? They could
not hope to hold it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lieutenant Summers shook his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too much for me,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s a mystery,
indeed. But I am not going to puzzle over
that phase of the matter now. What I am interested
in is in getting on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank, who had been lost in thought, spoke up
unexpectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Folsom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;isn&#8217;t it pretty certain
such a move would not be carried out except by a
man high in the councils of the smugglers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should imagine so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he would not run the risk of discovery and
capture without some very good cause?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;is it possible his reason for
this act is to drive the guards away or take them
prisoner in order to obtain temporary possession of
the house and remove incriminating papers&mdash;perhaps,
from some secret repository&mdash;which the smugglers
failed to take away or destroy when Lieutenant Summers
captured the place last week?&#8221;</p>
<p>The others were silent a few moments. Then Captain
Folsom said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, you are correct. Certainly, your theory
is plausible. And it would account for such a rash
step being taken, by the smugglers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Further general discussion was abandoned, as
Lieutenant Summers felt his services were needed on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
deck. The boat was nearing Starfish Cove. Night
had fallen. Another half hour would bring them in
sight of the strand. Captain Folsom went with the
boat&#8217;s commander to discuss campaign plans. The
boys were left to themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you think this mysterious man behind
the operations of the liquor runners can be?&#8221; Frank
asked, as they leaned in a group apart on the rail,
watching the phosphorescence in the water alongside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea,&#8221; confessed Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Unless, after all, it is Higginbotham.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Frank, &#8220;Captain Folsom declares it
cannot be he, that he himself is not a wealthy man,
and that he probably is only an agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The little scoundrel,&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
smooth one to take in Mr. McKay like that. Dad
always speaks of Mr. McKay very highly. Think
of Higginbotham playing the perfect secretary to
him, yet behind his back carrying on such plots as
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The beat of the engines began to slow down. They
were stealing along as close to the shore as Lieutenant
Summers dared venture with his craft. Not long
before, on this same coast, although not this very
spot, Eagle Boat 17 had run aground in the shallows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
during a fog, between East Hampton and Amagansett.
It behooved the Nark to proceed with caution.</p>
<p>The boys were in the bow now, peering ahead.
Starfish Cove was very near. Ahead lay the nearer
of the two horns enclosing it. Gradually the little
bay opened out around the point of land, and a dark
blot showed in the water. The moon had not yet
risen high, but it was a Summer night and not dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the bridge, the glare of the great
searchlight carried by the Nark cut through the
darkness like the stab of a sword. Lieutenant Summers
directed it be played full upon the dark
blot ahead, and instantly the latter stood out fully
illumined. It was a sub chaser.</p>
<p>Smoke was coming from her funnel. She had
steam up. She was preparing to depart. There were
a score of figures on her deck. But what delayed her
departure was the fact that she waited for a small
boat, dancing across the water toward her from the
shore. The latter caught full in the glare of the
searchlight contained a pair of men tugging frantically
at the oars, and a third seated in the stern,
grasping the tiller ropes and urging the rowers to
exert themselves to the utmost. He wore a cap
pulled far down to obscure his features, and did not
look up as did his companions when the light smote
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>There was excitement among those on deck of the
strange sub chaser. Men ran here and there, as if
undirected, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s running away,&#8221; cried Frank, suddenly.
&#8220;Look. In the small boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed. True enough, the man at the tiller
had swung her about for shore, and the rowers were
bending their backs as they sent her along on the
opposite course. Moreover, a few strokes more
would interpose the strange sub chaser between her
and the Nark, and whoever was aboard would escape.</p>
<p>It was a time for quick action. Lieutenant Summers
was equal to the occasion. Unknown to the
boys, he had ordered the three pounder unlimbered,
and now sent a shot ricochetting so close to the small
boat that the oarsmen were spattered by the spray
and the boat rocked violently. Nevertheless, exhorted
by their commander, the rowers, who had ceased at
first, bent anew to their oars. Another moment, and
they were under the stern of the strange vessel and
temporarily safe from danger of shot.</p>
<p>Jack, who had been watching developments breathlessly,
ran to the bridge, and called:</p>
<p>&#8220;May I make a suggestion, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Lieutenant Summers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever is in that boat is heading for the other
horn of land enclosing the cove,&#8221; said Jack, speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
rapidly. &#8220;He will land far out on a narrow peninsula.
If we send a boat ashore, on a tangent, we can
strike the base of the peninsula in time to cut off his
escape by land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; cried Lieutenant Summers. &#8220;I&#8217;ll order
the boat out at once. Do you go in it and point the
way.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE MAN HIGHER UP</h3>
</div>
<p>The menace of the shot under her stern, while
intended to bring-to the small boat, had the effect
of overaweing the strange sub chaser also. As Jack
at the tiller, with four men bending to the oars and
making the boat sweep through the water at a tremendous
rate, passed close astern, he was half fearful
a demonstration would be made against them. Nothing
of the sort occurred, however, and not even a
curious pair of eyes stared at them from the rail.</p>
<p>This was to be accounted for partly by the fact
that, immediately after launching and sending away
Jack&#8217;s boat, Lieutenant Summers dropped another
overside from the davits, and, accompanied by Captain
Folsom, headed directly for the ladder of the
strange sub chaser, which was down. And those
aboard had eyes only for him.</p>
<p>At the last minute, just as he was about to enter
his boat, he saw Frank and Bob watching him longingly
from the rail. He smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Want to come along?&#8221;</p>
<p>Did they? The two chums tumbled down the
ladder and into the boat so quickly that the invitation
was barely uttered when they already occupied seats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us have a pair of oars, sir,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;for
we can row, and otherwise, if you brought other
oarsmen in, we would be in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; consented Lieutenant Summers.
However, he detailed two sailors to take the other
pair of oars.</p>
<p>The boat bearing the boarding party drew up at
the floating stage and quickly Lieutenant Summers
bounded over the rail, followed by Captain Folsom,
Bob and Frank, and the two sailors. The boys drew
up in rank with the latter, while the two leaders
advanced a few steps. Nearly a score in number,
the crew of the strange sub chaser were grouped at
the foot of the bridge. None coming forward, Lieutenant
Summers said sharply:</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Summers, U. S. N., come aboard.
Who commands here?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no response. Instead, a struggle seemed
to be going on within the group, as if one of its
members were trying to escape and the others were
restraining him. At a sign from Lieutenant Summers,
the sailors loosed the automatics swinging in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
holsters about their waists, and prepared for
trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d stand a fine chance of getting shot without
being able to talk back,&#8221; whispered Frank to Bob.
&#8220;Neither of us armed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh,&#8221; Bob replied, out of the side of his mouth.
&#8220;I&#8217;d grab me somebody&#8217;s gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flurry, however, was short-lived. Suddenly,
a shrinking figure was expelled from the group of
men, as if shot from a cannon&#8217;s mouth. The searchlight
from the Nark was playing full upon the
scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your man,&#8221; cried a voice, from the group.
&#8220;Tryin&#8217; to hide, he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked up, fear and defiance in his features.
He was Higginbotham.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; cried Captain Folsom, sharply, taking a
step forward, &#8220;so it is you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Higginbotham looked about desperately, as if seeking
a way of escape. But he was cut off at the rail
by the guard from the Nark and the boys, while
the others had swung about him in a half-circle,
barring the way. Seeing an attempt to flee would be
futile, he pulled himself together, not without dignity,
and faced Captain Folsom and Lieutenant Summers.
It was to the former that he addressed himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve caught me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The game is up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>He folded his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; demanded Lieutenant
Summers, taking a hand in the proceedings. &#8220;Captain,
who is this man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow Higginbotham, about whom I told
you,&#8221; said Captain Folsom in an aside. &#8220;The man
who escaped from the Brownell place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221; Lieutenant Summers saw the light. He
addressed Higginbotham sternly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You and your men, masquerading in the uniforms
of officers and sailors of the U. S. N.,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You will pay heavily for this, my man. Such masquerade
is severely punished by the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Higginbotham started to reply, but Frank had an
idea. Not waiting to hear what the other had to say,
he impulsively stepped forward and plucked Captain
Folsom&#8217;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man is trying to delay us, Captain,&#8221; he
whispered. &#8220;I am sure of it. He wants the men in
the small boat to escape. I&#8217;ll bet, sir,&#8221; he said excitedly,
&#8220;that whoever is in that boat is the Man
Higher Up whom you are so anxious to capture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Folsom was struck by the cogency of
Frank&#8217;s reasoning. Signing to him to fall back, he
whispered to Lieutenant Summers. The latter listened,
then nodded. He stood silent a moment,
thinking.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll call another boat from
the Nark to go to the assistance of young Hampton.&#8221;</p>
<p>Placing a whistle to his lips, he blew a shrill blast.
A hail came from Jackson, second in command of
the Nark, at once. Lieutenant Summers ordered his
assistant to come aboard with four men. Waiting
the arrival of the other boat, Frank and Bob grew
fidgetty and spoke in whispers, while the two officers
questioned Higginbotham in low voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Frank to Bob, &#8220;I&#8217;ll ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Approaching the officers, he stood where Captain
Folsom&#8217;s eyes fell upon him, and the latter, seeing he
wanted a word with him, stepped aside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; said Frank, eagerly, &#8220;Bob and I feel
that we have got to go to help Jack. Can&#8217;t you persuade
Lieutenant Summers to let us accompany the
party?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other smiled slightly, then once more whispered
to Lieutenant Summers. The latter looked at
Frank, and nodded. Frank fell back to Bob&#8217;s side,
content.</p>
<p>They had not long to wait, before the boat bearing
Jackson and four men from the Nark nosed up to
their own craft at the landing stage, and Jackson
reported to his commander on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jackson,&#8221; Lieutenant Summers said to his young
petty officer, &#8220;I want you to take command here with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
your four men. Disarm these fellows. I do not
believe they will show trouble, but it will be well to
let them know right at the start that the Nark has
them under her guns. I am going to young Hampton&#8217;s
assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jackson saluted, and called his men aboard. Without
more ado, Lieutenant Summers, who was in
haste to be off, turned to descend to the boat when
once more Frank halted him:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are unarmed, Lieutenant,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. Just a moment. Jackson!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall order these men to give up their weapons.
Stand ready, and keep them covered. Now, my men,&#8221;
he added, addressing the crew; &#8220;I am going to place
you under arrest. I want you to advance one at a
time and submit to being searched and disarmed.
I warn you to submit without resistance, for if you
do not, the Nark yonder has orders to open fire, and
you cannot escape. Now, one at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sullenly, unwillingly, but overawed, the men advanced.
While the sailors from the Nark kept their
automatics in their hands, ready for action, Jackson
searched each man in businesslike fashion. The weapons
thus taken away&mdash;regulation automatics, as well
as a miscellaneous assortment of brass knuckles and a
few wicked daggers, all marking the men as city
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
toughs&mdash;were placed in a heap. Before the work had
been completed, Lieutenant Summers, anxious to
depart, signed to the boys to arm themselves. They
complied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let us go,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The boys and their two young sailor companions
tumbled into the outside boat, while Captain Folsom
and Lieutenant Summers delayed for another word
with Jackson. Then, they, too, descended. The
oars dipped, and the boat sped away.</p>
<p>All this had taken only a very short space of time.
However, the boat bearing the fugitives no longer
could be seen, although that carrying Jack&mdash;or, at
least, what they took to be his boat&mdash;was still offshore,
though close to it. It looked like a little dark
blot some distance ahead, nearing the landward base
of the peninsula. On that horn of land, all felt
assured, the fugitives had landed, and along it were
making their way to shore.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s boat now reached the shore. Lieutenant
Summers, gazing through the nightglass, spied Jack
and his quartette leap to land. Then he searched the
spit of land through the glass. An exclamation broke
from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young Hampton is just in time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
can see three figures running along the peninsula
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
towards him. Pull your hardest, lads, and we shall
soon be up with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two sailors and Bob and Frank bent to the
oars with a will, and the boat fairly leaped through
the water. Their backs were towards the land and
they could not see the development of events, but
Lieutenant Summers, realizing, perhaps, the anxiety
of the chums for their comrade, gave them occasional
bulletins. Jack and his party had taken cover, apparently,
for they could no longer be seen. Lieutenant
Summers was of the opinion, however, that their
presence was known to the enemy. It could not well
have been otherwise, as the latter must have seen
Jack&#8217;s man&oelig;uvre to cut them off.</p>
<p>Suddenly a half dozen shots rang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull your best lads. Almost there,&#8221; cried Lieutenant
Summers, who was in the bow. &#8220;Now. One
more big pull and we&#8217;ll be up on the sand.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a soft jar. The boat&#8217;s nose tilted
upwards. Then, disregarding footgear, all leaped
overside into the shallow water, and six pairs of
hands ran the boat well up on the sand.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; cried Lieutenant Summers, dashing
ahead.</p>
<p>The others followed on the run. No further shots
had been fired. But the sounds of panting men
engaged body to body in the brush came to them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
As he ran, Lieutenant Summers cast the rays of a
powerful hand light ahead. Right at the edge of
the trees the two parties were engaged. But the
fugitives were outnumbered, five to three, and, as
the reinforcements against them arrived, the struggle
came abruptly to an end.</p>
<p>The first upon whom Lieutenant Summer&#8217;s light
fell was Jack, astride a form. Then the light fell on
the fallen man&#8217;s features and a cry broke from Bob&#8217;s
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Mr. McKay.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>MCKAY&#8217;S STORY</h3>
</div>
<p>After all, the Mystery Was Easily Explained; The
Mystery as to the identity of the man behind the
operations of the liquor-smugglers. The explanation
of the whole situation was unfolded by Captain Folsom
several nights later at the Temple home. He
had come from New York City at the invitation of
Mr. Temple, whose curiosity was aroused by the
tales of the boys, and who wanted to hear a connected
account of events. In this matter, Captain
Folsom was willing to oblige, more especially by
reason of the aid given the government forces by
the boys.</p>
<p>J. B. McKay was the Man Higher Up. Higginbotham
was his agent. This man, one of the wealthiest
realty operators in New York, was a born
gambler. He could never resist the impulse to engage
in a venture that would bring him big returns
on his investment. In his realty operations, this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
quality had earned him the name of &#8220;Take a Chance&#8221;
McKay.</p>
<p>When the Eighteenth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution was adopted&mdash;the prohibition amendment&mdash;he
watched developments. He felt certain
that liquor smuggling would spring up. In this
he was not mistaken. New York became a vast
center of the traffic.</p>
<p>And as he beheld the great sums made by the
men bringing liquor into the country in defiance of
the law, the thought came to McKay of how these
individual operators might be united by a strong
and ruthless man, their methods improved, and a
vast fortune made by the man in control. Thereupon
he set about obtaining this control.</p>
<p>It was McKay, said Captain Folsom, who organized
the motor truck caravan which brought liquor
across the Canadian border into Northern New York
to a distributing center, a night&#8217;s run to the South,
whence it was sent across the land by express as
china and glassware from a china and glassware
manufactory. This factory was mere camouflage.
A plant did exist, but it was nothing more than a
storage warehouse at which the motor trucks unloaded
their cargoes.</p>
<p>Police protection was needed, of course, and police
protection McKay obtained. The factory so-called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
was in the open country, on the outskirts of a tiny
village. The local authorities were bribed. All along
the route from Canada, money was liberally spent in
order to prevent interference from police. Big cities
en route were avoided. The Highway of Grease
(&#8220;grease&#8221; meaning bribery) led around all such,
for in them usually the police were incorruptible.</p>
<p>It was McKay, too, who organized the airplane
carriage of liquor from Canada to points outside
New York City and to Stamford, Conn. One of his
planes only recently, explained Captain Folsom, had
fallen in a field near Croton-on-Hudson, with a valuable
cargo of liquor aboard after a night&#8217;s flight from
Canada.</p>
<p>But it was in organizing the importation of liquor
from the Bahamas that McKay reached his heights.
He had assembled a fleet of old schooners, many of
which had seen better days and lacked business,
commanded by skippers who were in desperate need
of money, and he had taken advantage of their
necessity by making what to them were tempting
offers. Some boats he had purchased outright, others
chartered for long periods.</p>
<p>These boats would work their way up the Atlantic
coast to specified points on the Jersey and Long
Island coastlines. Then they would discharge their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
cargoes, and men waiting alongshore with trucks
would carry the liquor to distributing points.</p>
<p>More recently, Captain Folsom added, McKay had
begun to utilize radio. To avoid the employment of
more than a minimum force of men, was his primary
object. In the first place, big crews made a steady
drain in wages. Likewise, there was an added danger
of mutiny when large crews were employed. The
men were bound to realize that, inasmuch as he was
violating the law, he could not appeal for legal retaliation
in case they should seize a vessel and dispose of
it and its contents. Therefore, he decided to depend
on trusty skippers, whom he paid well, and skeleton
crews whom the skippers and mates could control.</p>
<p>Thus the radio-controlled boats, which were really
not boats at all, came into existence. And for their
control, the station on Long Island was established
and two others, in isolated spots on the Jersey coast,
were in process of construction when the end came.
At the time of Higginbotham&#8217;s discovery by the
boys and their interference in McKay&#8217;s schemes,
McKay was absent in New Jersey, personally superintending
the construction of the plants.</p>
<p>Higginbotham, in fleeing from the Brownell place,
had neglected some damaging correspondence which
would have betrayed McKay&#8217;s identity as the controlling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
power in the liquor smuggling ring. He had
fled to his employer, and told him of the danger.</p>
<p>At the time, McKay had standing offshore an
Eagle boat, built for submarine chasing during the
World War, but which two years earlier the United
States government had sold during a period of reduction
of expenses. This boat he had kept in the
Bahamas, but recently had brought North. He intended
to use it to protect liquor runners as escort,
the assumption being that, thinking it one of themselves,
other boats of the &#8220;Dry Navy&#8221; would leave
the vessels alone.</p>
<p>How he had obtained possession of the naval
uniforms for his men Captain Folsom did not know.
However, the doughty captain assumed McKay
probably had bought discarded uniforms in some
manner, or else had had them made on order.</p>
<p>When Higginbotham reached him with the news,
after working his way through Brooklyn and New
York in disguise, having lain hidden several days in
order to avoid the first heat of the search which he
knew would be made for him, McKay had decided
to go to the Brownell place in the sub chaser. He
figured its appearance would disarm the suspicions
of the guards left by Lieutenant Summers, and that
his men in uniform would get close enough before
their identities were discovered to carry the place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
without force. Their superior numbers would compel
surrender on the part of a handful of guards.</p>
<p>Such proved to be the case. One of the guards,
however, escaped and, making his way to the Hampton
radio station, had sent out the call which brought
the Nark to the scene just as McKay was making
his escape.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>The boys received great praise for their part in
breaking up the plot, and bringing the perpetrators
to book. For them, the balance of the summer went
quietly. The escaping thieves who had stolen their
speed boat had made their way to McKay&#8217;s retreat
in New Jersey, and there later the boat was recovered.
In it, all spent many pleasant hours.</p>
<p>The budding romance between Marjorie Faulkner
and big Bob developed considerably during the balance
of her stay at the Temple home, which lasted
for several more weeks. They were together much
of the time, walking, swimming, boating, flying.
For the damaged airplane was repaired and Bob took
the young girl frequently aloft.</p>
<p>All five young people took part jointly in many
affairs, but Bob got Marjorie to himself as much as
possible. The others chaffed them a good deal,
but as the banter was all good-natured, it was not
resented.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>Della and Frank, too, drew more closely together
that summer. They had lived in the same house for
years, and had grown up together. Now as they
stood on the verge of young manhood and young
womanhood, a subtle change in their relations of
comradeship came to pass. They were still good
pals, but there was something deeper in their feelings
for each other.</p>
<p>Jack sighed one night, as he and his chums sat
alone on the beach, after a late plunge. The girls
had gone visiting with Mrs. Temple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Frank,&#8221; he said, &#8220;getting thicker every
day with Della. Here&#8217;s old Bob, who has lost his
head over Marjorie. I&#8217;m left out in the cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you go back to capture Senorita
Rafaela?&#8221; asked Bob, slyly. &#8220;When we flew away
from her ranch that day, you said you were going to
come back for her, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s reference was to the daughter of Don
Fernandez y Calomares, an aristocrat of pure Castilian
blood living in a palace in the Sonora mountains
in Old Mexico. The previous summer, the Don as
leader of a faction of Mexican rebels had kidnapped
Jack&#8217;s father, mining engineer in charge of oil properties
in New Mexico, and carried him prisoner to
his retreat. Thereby, the Don had hoped to embroil
the United States with President Obregon of Mexico,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
perhaps to bring about American intervention, all of
which would be of benefit to the rebel cause. Mr.
Temple, however, had decided the kidnapping of his
friend and business associate should be kept secret,
in order to prevent American intervention which he
considered would be harmful to both countries. The
boys had gone into Old Mexico and, through a series
of exciting adventures as related in &#8220;The Radio Boys
on the Mexican Border,&#8221; had effected Mr. Hampton&#8217;s
rescue. Jack had fallen victim to the charms of the
Don&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p>Now, at Bob&#8217;s words, Jack said nothing, but looked
away over the moonlit water.</p>
<p>Well, his thoughts often when he was alone were
concerned with the fascinating Spanish girl. Even
the passage of a year&#8217;s time had not served to efface
her image from his memory. Someday&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said he, jumping up, and pushing his
two companions over into the sand. &#8220;Beat you
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>He darted away, and they tore after him.</p>
<p>At the end of the summer, all three boys went
away to Yale at New Haven, Conn. Jack was in his
second year, a Sophomore. Bob and Frank entered
as Freshmen.</p>
<p>During their college year, all three kept alive their
interest in radio, and followed every new development.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
Jack even went further, inventing a revolutionary
device for the application of radio. Of
that, there is no space to speak now. But in an
account of their further adventures it will be properly
introduced.</p>
<p>The following vacation period, Mr. Hampton went
to Peru in connection with the development of rich
mining properties in a new region, and took Jack
with him. Frank and Bob pleaded so hard for permission
to accompany the Hamptons that Mr. Temple
gave his consent.</p>
<p>There, an amazing series of adventures befell
them. But they will be duly recorded in &#8220;The Radio
Boys Search for the Incas&#8217; Treasure.&#8221;</p>
